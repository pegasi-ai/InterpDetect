Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $ 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement. Management performance measures the following financial measurements are on a non-u. S. Gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report. Non-u. S. Gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u. S. Gaap. A presentation of earnings in accordance with u. S. Gaap is available in item 8 of this report. Free cash flow management internally uses a free cash flow measure: ( 1 ) to evaluate the company 2019s operating results, ( 2 ) to plan stock buyback levels, ( 3 ) to evaluate strategic investments and ( 4 ) to evaluate the company 2019s ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is not a defined term under u. S. Gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property, plant and equipment ( capital spending ). Free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company 2019s cash flow statements; however, it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\nQuestion:without the charge for the a\/r securitization , what would cash flows provided by operating activities for all operations in 2010 have been ( in millions ) ?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,705],[706,1159],[1160,4037],[4038,4047],[4048,4204],[4205,4212]],"num_tokens":999,"response":"The context states that cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 were $515.2 million, which **included a use of $250 million** related to the change in accounting for the accounts receivable (A\/R) securitization program.

We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. Retail marketing ssa, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway ae and superamerica ae brands. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. Ssa retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. As of december 31, 2008, ssa had 1617 retail outlets in nine states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2008. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $ 2838 million in 2008, $ 2796 million in 2007 and $ 2706 million in 2006. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of ssa markets, usually with the highest demand during the summer driving season. Profit levels from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. In october 2008, we sold our interest in pilot travel centers llc ( 201cptc 201d ), an operator of travel centers in the united states. Pipeline transportation we own a system of pipelines through marathon pipe line llc ( 201cmpl 201d ) and ohio river pipe line llc ( 201corpl 201d ), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. Our mpl and orpl wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1815 miles of crude oil lines and 1826 miles of refined product lines comprising 34 systems located in 11 states. The mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states, based on total barrels delivered. Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Third parties generated 11 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines in 2008.

Based on the context, the rental expenses mentioned are for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, and 2002, not 2003. There is no rental expense data for 2003 provided in the context.Given this, I will interpret the question as: **\"What was the decrease in rental expense (millions) for operating leases in continuing operations from 2001 to 2002?\"**From the context, rental expense for operating leases (excluding the sale\/leaseback) was:- 2002: $31 million (total), including $6 million related to discontinued operations  \n- 2001: $32 million (total), including $16 million related to discontinued operationsSince we want operating leases in **continuing operations**, we exclude discontinued operations:- 2002 continuing operations: $31 million - $6 million = $25 million  \n- 2001 continuing operations: $32 million - $16 million = $16 millionCalculating the change:Rental expense in continuing operations from 2001 to 2002:= 2002 continuing ops rental expense - 2001 continuing ops rental expense  \n= $25 million - $16 million  \n= **$9 million increase**So, there was actually an **increase** of $9 million in rental expense in continuing operations from 2001 to 2002—not a decrease.If instead we try 2000 to 2001:- 2000: $13 million total, including $6 million discontinued  \nContinuing operations 2000 = $13 million - $6 million = $7 million  \n- 2001 continuing operations as above = $16 millionChange from 2000 to 2001 in continuing operations:= $16 million - $7 million = $9 million increaseAgain, an increase.No rental expense data for 2003 is provided, so no decrease from 2003 to 2003 is available.**Final answer:**There is no data on rental expense for operating leases in continuing operations for 2003 in the context provided.

This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. The following table sets forth the volume of map 2019s consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales ( thousands of barrels per day ) 2003 2002 2001.[[\"( thousands of barrels per day )\", \"2003\", \"2002\", \"2001\"], [\"gasoline\", \"776\", \"773\", \"748\"], [\"distillates\", \"365\", \"346\", \"345\"], [\"propane\", \"21\", \"22\", \"21\"], [\"feedstocks and special products\", \"97\", \"82\", \"71\"], [\"heavy fuel oil\", \"24\", \"20\", \"41\"], [\"asphalt\", \"74\", \"75\", \"78\"], [\"total\", \"1357\", \"1318\", \"1304\"], [\"matching buy\/sell volumes included in above\", \"64\", \"71\", \"45\"]]Map sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin.

See note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion on the formula rate plan and the storm damage rider. The volume\/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 153 gwh, or 1% ( 1 % ), in billed electricity usage, including an increase in industrial usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to expansion projects in the pulp and paper industry, increased demand for existing customers, primarily in the metals industry, and new customers in the wood products industry.\nQuestion:what is the net change in net revenue during 20016 for entergy mississippi , inc.?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1444],[1445,1726],[1727,2572],[2573,2582],[2583,2664],[2665,2672]],"num_tokens":630,"response":"The net change in net revenue for Entergy Mississippi, Inc. during 2016 compared to 2015 can be calculated from the values provided in the context.- 2015 net revenue: $696.3 million  \n- 2016 net revenue: $705.4 million  Net change = 2016 net revenue - 2015 net revenue  \nNet change = $705.4 million - $696.3 million = $9.1 million increase**Reasoning:** The context explicitly states the 2015 and 2016 net revenues and provides details explaining the components affecting the change.

Since the specific 2015 or 2014 pension benefit payments are not given, but the 2016 pension benefit payment for U.S. qualified and non-qualified is $987 million, we can assume the 2015 payment would be close to this amount (slightly less or more), but the exact figure is not provided. Since only 2016 onwards data is given, we can only reasonably compare contributions to approximate benefit payments around that time.---**Step 3: Calculate ratio**Assuming pension benefits in 2015 are roughly equal to 2016's $987 million for the U.S., we calculate the ratio of contributions to benefits:- 2015: Contribution = $264 million  \n- 2015 Approximate benefits = $987 million  \nRatio 2015 = 264 \/ 987 ≈ 0.2675 (26.75%)- 2014: Contribution = $210 million  \n- 2014 Approximate benefits ~ (not given, but likely slightly less than 2015, so using ~ $975 million as a rough estimate, given 2016 is $987 million)  Ratio 2014 = 210 \/ 975 ≈ 0.215 (21.5%)---**Step 4: Ratio comparison**Ratio of 2015 contribution to benefit ratio over 2014 contribution to benefit ratio:= 0.2675 \/ 0.215 ≈ 1.245 (about 24.5% higher in 2015 compared to 2014)---### Final Answer:The company's contribution relative to the U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension benefits in 2015 was approximately 24.5% higher than in 2014.

Our interests in our communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to the loan agreement for the securitization, the tower sites subject to the securitization are subject to mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. There are three principal types of towers: guyed, self- supporting lattice, and monopole. 2022 a guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground. A guyed tower can reach heights of up to 2000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres. 2022 a lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10000 square feet for a rural site or less than 2500 square feet for a metropolitan site. 2022 a monopole is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of less than 2500 square feet.\nQuestion:what is the square footage of properties in massachusetts?\\\\n\\\\n\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,385],[386,1181],[1182,3581],[3582,3591],[3592,3655],[3656,3663]],"num_tokens":828,"response":"The properties in Massachusetts are located in Boston, Southborough, and Woburn.

The increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $ 5 2022 billion is driven by a $ 6. 2 billion increase from net transfers in as the continued credit crisis impacted the availability of observable inputs for the underlying securities related to this liability. This was offset by a reduction from net settlements of $ 1. 4 billion. The decrease in short-term borrowings of $ 3. 7 billion is due to net transfers 2022 out of $ 1. 8 billion as valuation methodology inputs considered to be unobservable were determined not to be significant to the overall valuation. In addition, net payments of $ 1. 8 billion were made during the year. The increase in 2022 long-term debt of $ 2. 2 billion is driven by: the net transfers in of $ 38. 8 billion, substantially all of which related 2013 to the transfer of consolidated siv debt in the first quarter of 2008, as the availability of observable inputs continued to decline due to the current crisis; offset by $ 2. 2 billion in gains recognized as credit spreads widened during the 2013 year; and $ 34. 3 billion decrease from net settlements\/payments. Included in 2013 these settlements were $ 21 billion of payments made on maturing siv debt and the replacement of $ 17 billion of non-recourse, consolidated siv debt classified as level 3 with citigroup debt classified as level 2. This replacement occurred in connection with the purchase of the siv assets by the company in november 2008. Items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale that are measured at locom that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. The fair value of loans measured on a locom basis is determined where possible using quoted secondary-market prices. Such loans are generally classified as level 2 of the fair-value hierarchy given the level of activity in the market and the frequency of available quotes. If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset or assets, adjusted for the specific attributes of that loan.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:With respect to our business operations, we are standardizing certain core business processes, primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology, and driving automation of these business processes. We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 400 million to $ 450 million over the four-year period ending december 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $ 289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $ 156 million in 2010 and $ 133 million in 2011. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: ( in millions ) employee-related real estate consolidation information technology costs total.[[\"( in millions )\", \"employee-related costs\", \"real estate consolidation\", \"information technology costs\", \"total\"], [\"2010\", \"$ 105\", \"$ 51\", \"\", \"$ 156\"], [\"2011\", \"85\", \"7\", \"$ 41\", \"133\"], [\"total\", \"$ 190\", \"$ 58\", \"$ 41\", \"$ 289\"]]The employee-related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services. Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above-described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1400 employees, or approximately 5% ( 5 % ) of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of december 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $ 86 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run-rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $ 400 million to $ 450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre-tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $ 575 million to $ 625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 160 million in 2015. These annual pre-tax run-rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program. Our actual operating expenses may increase or decrease as a result of other factors. The majority of the annualized savings will affect compensation and employee benefits expenses; these savings will be modestly offset by increases in information systems and communications expenses as we implement the program. 2011 expense control measures during the fourth quarter of 2011, in connection with expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets-facing businesses in 2012, we took two actions.

This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in financial instruments owned, at fair value of $ 67. 89 billion, primarily due to decreases in u. S. Government and federal agency obligations, non-u. S. Government and agency obligations, derivatives and commodities, and a decrease in other assets of $ 17. 11 billion, primarily due to the sale of a majority stake in our americas reinsurance business in april 2013. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in collateralized agreements of $ 48. 07 billion, due to firm and client activity. As of december 2013, total liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition were $ 833. 04 billion, a decrease of $ 29. 80 billion from december 2012. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other liabilities and accrued expenses of $ 26. 35 billion, primarily due to the sale of a majority stake in both our americas reinsurance business in april 2013 and our european insurance business in december 2013, and a decrease in collateralized financings of $ 9. 24 billion, primarily due to firm financing activities. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in payables to customers and counterparties of $ 10. 21 billion. As of december 2013, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $ 164. 78 billion, which was 5% ( 5 % ) higher and 4% ( 4 % ) higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december 2013, respectively. The increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2013 was primarily due to an increase in client activity at the end of the period. As of december 2012, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $ 171. 81 billion, which was essentially unchanged and 3% ( 3 % ) higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december 2012, respectively. The increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2012 was primarily due to an increase in firm financing activities at the end of the period. The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as u. S.

Summary of environmental reserves as of december 31, 2011.[[\"\", \"total reserves\"], [\"gross [1] [2]\", \"\"], [\"direct\", \"$ 271\"], [\"assumed reinsurance\", \"39\"], [\"london market\", \"57\"], [\"total\", \"367\"], [\"ceded\", \"-47 ( 47 )\"], [\"net\", \"$ 320\"]][1] the one year gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58, resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of 6. 4. [2] the three year average gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58, resulting in a three year gross survival ratio of 6. 4. During the second quarters of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company completed its annual ground-up asbestos reserve evaluations. As part of these evaluations, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its london market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. Based on this evaluation, the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011. During 2011, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim frequency, severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims, particularly against certain smaller, more peripheral insureds. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. The net effect of these changes in 2010 and 2009 resulted in $ 169 and $ 138 increases in net asbestos reserves, respectively. The company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually. The company divides its gross asbestos exposures into direct, assumed reinsurance and london market. The company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories: major asbestos defendants ( the 201ctop 70 201d accounts in tillinghast 2019s published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts ), which are subdivided further as: structured settlements, wellington, other major asbestos defendants, accounts with future expected exposures greater than $ 2. 5, accounts with future expected exposures less than $ 2. 5, and unallocated. 2022 structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured. 2022 the wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the 201cwellington agreement 201d dated june 19, 1985. The wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers. 2022 the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers 1 and 2, as defined by tillinghast that are not wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with the hartford. The tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims. 2022 accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $ 2. 5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants. 2022 the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account with future expected exposure of greater than $ 2. 5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $ 2. 5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.\nQuestion:in 2011 what was the summary of environmental reserves as of december 31 , 2011\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,449],[450,634],[635,4580],[4581,4590],[4591,4669],[4670,4677]],"num_tokens":1024,"response":"As of December 31, 2011, the summary of environmental reserves was as follows:- Gross reserves by category:  \n  - Direct: $271 million  \n  - Assumed reinsurance: $39 million  \n  - London market: $57 million  \n  - Total gross reserves: $367 million  - Ceded reserves (amounts ceded to reinsurers): -$47 million  \n- Net reserves (gross reserves minus ceded amounts): $320 million  **Reasoning:**  \nThe company's environmental reserves are categorized into three segments: direct, assumed reinsurance, and London market.

Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011.

S. Dispensing business within the medication management solutions ( 201cmms 201d ) unit of the medical segment, the company amended the terms of certain customer leases for dispensing equipment within the mms unit. The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 840, \"leases\", as the non- cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% ( 75 % ) of the equipment 2019s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% ( 90 % ) of the equipment 2019s fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term. Accordingly, most amended lease contracts were classified as operating leases beginning in april 2017. The change in lease classification resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in fiscal year 2017 of $ 748 million, which was recorded in other operating expense, net.

On july 13, 2006, the company completed the acquisition of r2 technology, inc. ( 201cr2 201d ) pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated april 24, 2006. The results of operations for r2 have been included in the company 2019s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition as part of its mammography\/breast care business segment. R2, previously located in santa clara, california, develops and sells computer-aided detection technology and products ( 201ccad 201d ), an innovative technology that assists radiologists in the early detection of breast cancer. The aggregate purchase price for r2 of approximately $ 220600 consisted of approximately 8800 shares of hologic common stock valued at $ 205500, cash paid of $ 6900, debt assumed of $ 5700 and approximately $ 2500 for acquisition related fees and expenses. The company determined the fair value of the shares issued in connection with the acquisition in accordance with eitf issue no. 99-12, determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination. The components and allocation of the purchase price, consists of the following approximate amounts:.[[\"net tangible assets acquired as of july 13 2006\", \"$ 1200\"], [\"in-process research and development\", \"10200\"], [\"developed technology and know-how\", \"39500\"], [\"customer relationship\", \"15700\"], [\"trade name\", \"3300\"], [\"order backlog\", \"800\"], [\"deferred income taxes\", \"6700\"], [\"goodwill\", \"143200\"], [\"final purchase price\", \"$ 220600\"]]The company finalized and completed a plan to restructure certain of r2 2019s historical activities. As of the acquisition date the company recorded a liability of approximately $ 798 in accordance with eitf issue no. 95-3, recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination, related to the termination of certain employees and loss related to the abandonment of certain lease space under this plan. All amounts under this plan have been paid as of september 29, 2007. The company reduced goodwill related to the r2 acquisition in the amount of approximately $ 2300 and $ 400 during the years ended september 27, 2008 and september 29, 2007, respectively. The reduction in 2007 was primarily related to a change in the preliminary valuation of certain assets and liabilities acquired based on information received during the year. The decrease in goodwill in 2008 was related to the reduction of an income tax liability. The final purchase price allocations were completed and the adjustments did not have a material impact on the company 2019s financial position or results of operation. As part of the purchase price allocation, all intangible assets that were a part of the acquisition were identified and valued. It was determined that only customer relationship, trade name, developed technology and know how and in-process research and development had separately identifiable values. Customer relationship represents r2 2019s strong active customer base, dominant market position and strong partnership with several large companies. Trade name represents the r2 product names that the company intends to continue to use. Order backlog consists of customer orders for which revenue has not yet been recognized. Developed technology and know how represents currently marketable purchased products that the company continues to resell as well as utilize to enhance and incorporate into the company 2019s existing products. The estimated $ 10200 of purchase price allocated to in-process research and development projects primarily related to r2 2019s digital cad products.

We also produce asphalt cements, polymerized asphalt, asphalt emulsions and industrial asphalts. Retail marketing ssa, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway ae and superamerica ae brands. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. Ssa retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. As of december 31, 2008, ssa had 1617 retail outlets in nine states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2008. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $ 2838 million in 2008, $ 2796 million in 2007 and $ 2706 million in 2006. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of ssa markets, usually with the highest demand during the summer driving season. Profit levels from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than profit levels from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. In october 2008, we sold our interest in pilot travel centers llc ( 201cptc 201d ), an operator of travel centers in the united states. Pipeline transportation we own a system of pipelines through marathon pipe line llc ( 201cmpl 201d ) and ohio river pipe line llc ( 201corpl 201d ), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the midwest and gulf coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems. Our mpl and orpl wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1815 miles of crude oil lines and 1826 miles of refined product lines comprising 34 systems located in 11 states. The mpl common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the united states, based on total barrels delivered. Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and federal energy regulatory commission regulations and guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Third parties generated 11 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our mpl and orpl common carrier pipelines in 2008.

We also recorded $ 5. 4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures in 2008. Restricted cash and restricted marketable securities as of december 31, 2010, we had $ 172. 8 million of restricted cash and restricted marketable securities. We obtain funds through the issuance of tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of financing qualifying expenditures at our landfills, transfer stations, and collection and recycling facilities. The funds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authorities at the time of issuance. As the use of these funds is contractually restricted, and we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes, they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. In the normal course of business, we may be required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities in connection with municipal residential collection contracts, closure or post- republic services, inc.

Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other limitations. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock awards performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Vesting of the awards is dependent on devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. In order for awards to vest, the performance target must be met in the first year, and if met, recipients are entitled to dividends on the awards over the remaining service vesting period. If the performance target and service period requirements are not met, the award does not vest. Devon estimates the fair values of the awards as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing devon 2019s tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified two- or three- year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200% ( 200 % ) of the units granted depending on devon 2019s tsr as compared to the peer group on the vesting date. At the end of the vesting period, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: ( i ) a risk-free interest rate based on u. S.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. Credit default swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract.

However, if a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit indices, baskets and tranches. Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation.

The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure.

Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. Credit options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

Commitments and contingencies litigation 2014the company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the company 2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Tristar litigation 2014the company was involved in several lawsuits against tristar investors llp and its affiliates ( 201ctristar 201d ) in various states regarding single tower sites where tristar had taken land interests under the company 2019s owned or managed sites and the company believes tristar induced the landowner to breach obligations to the company. In addition, on february 16, 2012, tristar brought a federal action against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of texas ( the 201cdistrict court 201d ), in which tristar principally alleged that the company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with tristar for land under the company 2019s owned or managed sites. On january 22, 2013, the company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against tristar and certain of its employees, denying tristar 2019s claims and asserting that tristar engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: ( i ) entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and ( ii ) making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both tristar and the company. Pursuant to a settlement agreement dated july 9, 2014, all pending state and federal actions between the company and tristar were dismissed with prejudice and without payment of damages. Lease obligations 2014the company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option.

We concluded that we had forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet with the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. Therefore, the lease is accounted for as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to ( 1 ) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; ( 2 ) imputed interest expense; and ( 3 ) land lease expense ( which is considered an operating lease and a component of cost of goods sold and operating expenses ) representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the building. In addition, the underlying building asset is depreciated over the building 2019s estimated useful life of 30 years. At the conclusion of the initial lease term, we will de-recognize both the net book values of the asset and the remaining financing obligation. Purchase commitments we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations to third-party contract manufacturers, who procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply. We issue purchase orders to our contract manufacturers for finished product and a significant portion of these orders consist of firm non- cancelable commitments. In addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are non-cancelable, including integrated circuits, which are consigned to our contract manufacturers. As of december 31, 2015, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments of $ 43. 9 million to our contract manufacturers and suppliers. We have provided restricted deposits to our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors to secure our obligations to purchase inventory. We had $ 2. 3 million in restricted deposits as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. Restricted deposits are classified in other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees we have entered into agreements with some of our direct customers and channel partners that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. We have at our option and expense the ability to repair any infringement, replace product with a non-infringing equivalent-in-function product or refund our customers.\nQuestion:as of december 31 , 2015 , are purchase commitments greater than expected 2016 lease commitments?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,297],[298,751],[752,3321],[3322,3331],[3332,3428],[3429,3436]],"num_tokens":765,"response":"To determine whether the purchase commitments as of December 31, 2015, are greater than the expected lease commitments for 2016, we compare the two amounts from the context:- Purchase commitments as of December 31, 2015: **$43.9 million**\n- Future minimum lease payment for the year ending December 31, 2016: **$5,754,000** (or $5.754 million)Comparison:\n- $43.9 million (purchase commitments) \n- $5.754 million (2016 lease commitments)Since $43.9 million is significantly greater than $5.754 million, **purchase commitments are greater than the expected 2016 lease commitments.****Answer:** Yes, as of December 31, 2015, purchase commitments of $43.9 million are greater than the expected 2016 lease commitments of $5.754 million.","response_spans":[[0,172],[173,342],[343,435],[436,579],[580,730]],"labels":[],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response is fully supported by the context as it accurately extracts and compares the relevant numbers: purchase commitments ($43.9 million) and the future minimum lease payment for 2016 ($5.754 million).

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Net impairment we recognized $ 16. 9 million and $ 14. 9 million of net impairment during the years ended december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, on certain securities in our non-agency cmo portfolio due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in those specific securities. The gross other-than-temporary impairment ( 201cotti 201d ) and the noncredit portion of otti, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income ( loss ), are shown in the table below ( dollars in millions ): year ended december 31, 2012 2011.[[\"\", \"year ended december 31 2012\", \"2011\"], [\"other-than-temporary impairment ( 201cotti 201d )\", \"$ -19. 8 ( 19. 8 )\", \"$ -9. 2 ( 9. 2 )\"], [\"less: noncredit portion of otti recognized into ( out of ) other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( before tax )\", \"2. 9\", \"-5. 7 ( 5. 7 )\"], [\"net impairment\", \"$ -16. 9 ( 16. 9 )\", \"$ -14. 9 ( 14. 9 )\"]]Provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased 20% ( 20 % ) to $ 354. 6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in provision for loan losses was driven primarily by improving credit trends, as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, and loan portfolio run-off. The decrease was partially offset by $ 50 million in charge-offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings during the third quarter of 2012, with approximately 80% ( 80 % ) related to prior years. We utilize third party loan servicers to obtain bankruptcy data on our borrowers and during the third quarter of 2012, we identified an increase in bankruptcies reported by one specific servicer. In researching this increase, we discovered that the servicer had not been reporting historical bankruptcy data on a timely basis. As a result, we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data. Through this additional process, approximately $ 90 million of loans were identified in which servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to us, approximately 90% ( 90 % ) of which were current at the end of the third quarter of 2012. As a result, these loans were written down to the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs, or approximately $ 40 million, during the third quarter of 2012. These charge-offs resulted in an increase to provision for loan losses of $ 50 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses has declined four consecutive years, down 78% ( 78 % ) from its peak of $ 1. 6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2008. We expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline over the long term, although it is subject to variability in any given quarter.\nQuestion:what was the change in otti between 2011 and 2012 , in millions?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,736],[737,1083],[1084,3004],[3005,3014],[3015,3078],[3079,3086]],"num_tokens":792,"response":"The context provides the following data regarding other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 (all amounts in millions):- OTTI for 2012: -$19.8 million  \n- OTTI for 2011: -$9.2 millionTo find the change in OTTI between 2011 and 2012, subtract the 2011 OTTI from the 2012 OTTI:Change in OTTI = OTTI (2012) - OTTI (2011)  \nChange in OTTI = -19.8 - (-9.2)  \nChange in OTTI = -19.8 + 9.2  \nChange in OTTI = -10.6 million**Answer:** The OTTI increased by $10.6 million (a greater impairment) from 2011 to 2012.","response_spans":[[0,161],[162,225],[226,317],[318,457],[458,546]],"labels":[{"start":415,"end":417,"confidence":0.5185377598,"text":"19"},{"start":418,"end":419,"confidence":0.5574982166,"text":"8"},{"start":421,"end":425,"confidence":0.5603890419,"text":" 9.2"},{"start":428,"end":466,"confidence":0.9194592237,"text":"Change in OTTI = -10.6 million**Answer"},{"start":469,"end":547,"confidence":0.916597724,"text":" The OTTI increased by $10.6 million (a greater impairment) from 2011 to 2012."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response accurately calculates the change in OTTI between 2011 and 2012 using the data provided in the context.

An unfavorable impact on operating income due to currency means that foreign exchange fluctuations negatively affected operating income by $9.0 million.Since the impact is described as \"unfavorable\" on operating income (which measures profitability from operations), this implies either a decrease in revenue or an increase in operating expenses caused by currency exchange effects. The context specifically quantifies the unfavorable impact on operating income, but does not separate revenue and operating expense impacts explicitly. However, revenue included $100.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact, which relates more to top-line revenue rather than expenses.Given there is no direct data on operating expense impact, but operating income declined by $9.0 million due to currency, and revenue declined by $100.8 million, it suggests the unfavorable impact on operating expenses is not separately quantified or significant compared to these figures.**Answer:**  \nThe unfavorable impact on operating income in 2012 due to a stronger U.S. Dollar was $9.0 million.

Under the relief act, the company 2019s 2010 minimum required contribution to its defined benefit pension plans was reduced from $ 525 million to approximately $ 460 million.

Intangible assets the company has recorded international slot and route authorities of $ 708 million and $ 736 million as of december 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The company considers these assets indefinite life assets and as a result, they are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Such triggering events may include significant changes to the company 2019s network or capacity, or the implementation of open skies agreements in countries where the company operates flights. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the company performed its annual impairment testing on international slots and routes, at which time the net carrying value was reassessed for recoverability. It was determined through this annual impairment testing that the fair value of certain international routes in latin america was less than the carrying value. Thus, the company incurred an impairment charge of $ 28 million to write down the values of these and certain other slots and routes. As there is minimal market activity for the valuation of routes and international slots and landing rights, the company measures fair value with inputs using the income approach. The income approach uses valuation techniques, such as future cash flows, to convert future amounts to a single present discounted amount. The inputs utilized for these valuations are unobservable and reflect the company 2019s assumptions about market participants and what they would use to value the routes and accordingly are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines\/loans is reported in the non- strategic assets portfolio segment. Loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans pnc sold to the investors are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan 2019s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. We investigate every investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to settlement with that investor. Indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor 2019s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor, we typically respond to home equity indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. Most home equity sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests. Investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors.

This balance is comprised of $ 0. 3 million in severance and related charges, $ 0. 1 million in lease termination costs, and $ 0. 4 million in canceled contracts. The majority of the accrual is expected to be paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Cash payments for the twelve months ended december 3, 1999 related to the fiscal 1998 restructuring were $ 0. 7 million, $ 3. 6 million, and $ 0. 4 million for severance and related charges, lease termination costs, and canceled contracts costs, respectively. In addition, adjustments related to the fiscal 1998 restructuring were made during the year, which consisted of $ 0. 4 million related to estimated lease termination costs and $ 0. 3 mil- lion related to other charges. Included in the accrual balance as of november 27, 1998 were lease termination costs related to previously announced restructuring programs in fiscal 1994 and 1995. Cash payments for the twelve months ended december 3, 1999 related to both restructuring programs were $ 1. 5 million. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded adjustments to the accrual balance of approximately $ 1. 2 million related to these programs. An adjustment of $ 0. 6 million was made in the third quarter of fiscal 1999 due to the company 2019s success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified. In addition, $ 0. 6 million was reduced from the restructuring accrual relating to expired lease termination costs for two facilities resulting from the merger with frame in fiscal 1995. As of december 3, 1999 no accrual balances remain related to the aldus and frame mergers. Other charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded other charges of $ 8. 4 million that were unusual in nature.

Due to the material ongoing modifications of the business, management has determined that insufficient information exists to accurately develop meaningful historical pro forma financial information. Moreover, the historical operations of blockbuster materially changed during the periods preceding the acquisition as a result of blockbuster inc. 2019s bankruptcy proceedings, and any historical pro forma information would not prove useful in assessing our post acquisition earnings and cash flows. The cost of goods sold on a unit basis for blockbuster in the current period was lower-than-historical costs. The carrying values in the current period of the rental library and merchandise inventories ( 201cblockbuster inventory 201d ) were reduced to their estimated fair value due to the application of purchase accounting. This impact on cost of goods sold on a unit basis will diminish in the future as we purchase new blockbuster inventory. 10. Spectrum investments terrestar transaction gamma acquisition l. L. C. ( 201cgamma 201d ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network, entered into the terrestar transaction on june 14, 2011. On july 7, 2011, the u. S. Bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approved the asset purchase agreement with terrestar and we subsequently paid $ 1. 345 billion of the cash purchase price. Dish network is a party to the asset purchase agreement solely with respect to certain guaranty obligations. We have paid all but $ 30 million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction, which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction, or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011.

Cash, intangibles, and liabilities are excluded.From the table:  \n- Property and equipment ($28,663) is certainly hard assets.  \n- Current assets ($153,258) include inventory but also cash and receivables; however, cash is separately listed at $107,061, so the remainder of current assets ($153,258 - cash portion within current assets) would include inventory and receivables.  But the cash of $107,061 is separately listed; it is not included in current assets here (the context suggests cash is separate). So current assets can be assumed to exclude cash here, making current assets = inventory and other current assets (like receivables).Hence, the physical components of current assets such as inventory can be considered hard assets, while receivables are financial assets, not hard. Without further breakdown, we must assume all current assets are counted as hard assets for this calculation, or at least most of it given the nature of Blockbuster's inventory.- Other noncurrent assets ($12,856) are likely intangible or financial, so exclude.---**Step 2: Calculate total hard assets**  \n- Property and equipment: $28,663  \n- Current assets: $153,258  \n- Cash: exclude, since it's financial asset  \n- Acquisition intangibles: exclude  \n- Other noncurrent assets: exclude  \n- Liabilities are negative and excluded from assets calculation.Total hard assets = $28,663 + $153,258 = $181,921 thousand---**Step 3: Calculate percentage of hard assets**  \nTotal purchase price = $233,584 thousandPercentage = (Hard assets \/ Total purchase price) × 100  \n= (181,921 \/ 233,584) × 100  \n≈ 77.9%---**Final Answer:**  \nHard assets represented approximately **78%** of the total Blockbuster purchase price.","response_spans":[[0,189],[190,469],[470,472],[473,695],[696,1026],[1027,1289],[1290,1614],[1615,1697],[1698,1700],[1701,1991],[1992,2049],[2050,2052],[2053,2142],[2143,2237],[2238,2240],[2241,2346]],"labels":[{"start":831,"end":852,"confidence":0.7973496318,"text":" cash and receivables"},{"start":904,"end":1025,"confidence":0.7912018299,"text":" the remainder of current assets ($153,258 - cash portion within current assets) would include inventory and receivables."},{"start":1120,"end":1128,"confidence":0.5235683322,"text":" context"},{"start":1142,"end":1154,"confidence":0.5588722825,"text":" is separate"},{"start":1249,"end":1288,"confidence":0.6581478119,"text":" other current assets (like receivables"},{"start":1387,"end":1437,"confidence":0.8517566323,"text":" while receivables are financial assets, not hard."},{"start":1464,"end":1472,"confidence":0.5264511704,"text":" we must"},{"start":1483,"end":1525,"confidence":0.7109213471,"text":" current assets are counted as hard assets"},{"start":1929,"end":1932,"confidence":0.5433599353,"text":" Li"},{"start":1941,"end":1991,"confidence":0.5899202228,"text":" are negative and excluded from assets calculation"},{"start":1992,"end":2050,"confidence":0.8962457776,"text":"Total hard assets = $28,663 + $153,258 = $181,921 thousand"},{"start":2150,"end":2153,"confidence":0.509160459,"text":"age"},{"start":2194,"end":2198,"confidence":0.5049182177,"text":" 100"},{"start":2202,"end":2204,"confidence":0.6186375618,"text":" ("},{"start":2208,"end":2209,"confidence":0.5339002609,"text":"9"},{"start":2222,"end":2228,"confidence":0.5494884849,"text":" × 100"},{"start":2231,"end":2238,"confidence":0.8480864763,"text":"≈ 77.9%"},{"start":2261,"end":2347,"confidence":0.8818315864,"text":"Hard assets represented approximately **78%** of the total Blockbuster purchase price."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response is a detailed calculation based on the numbers provided in the context, specifically using the purchase price allocation table for Blockbuster.

Loans outstanding and related unfunded commitments are concentrated in our primary geographic markets. At december 31, 2007, no specific industry concentration exceeded 5% ( 5 % ) of total commercial loans outstanding and unfunded commitments. In the normal course of business, we originate or purchase loan products whose contractual features, when concentrated, may increase our exposure as a holder and servicer of those loan products. Possible product terms and features that may create a concentration of credit risk would include loan products whose terms permit negative amortization, a high loan-to-value ratio, features that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments above increases in market interest rates, below-market interest rates and interest-only loans, among others. We originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. These products are standard in the financial services industry and the features of these products are considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk of this product feature that may result in borrowers not being able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product features create a concentration of credit risk. We also originate home equity loans and lines of credit that result in a credit concentration of high loan-to-value ratio loan products at the time of origination. In addition, these loans are concentrated in our primary geographic markets as discussed above. At december 31, 2007, $ 2. 7 billion of the $ 14. 4 billion of home equity loans ( included in 201cconsumer 201d in the table above ) had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 90% ( 90 % ). These loans are collateralized primarily by 1-4 family residential properties. As part of our asset and liability management activities, we also periodically purchase residential mortgage loans that are collateralized by 1-4 family residential properties. At december 31, 2007, $ 3. 0 billion of the $ 9. 6 billion of residential mortgage loans were interest- only loans. We realized net gains from sales of commercial mortgages of $ 39 million in 2007, $ 55 million in 2006 and $ 61 million in 2005.

Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of merchandise purchase costs as earned. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying sg&a expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products may be offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs.

Impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. In accordance with accounting standards for long-lived assets, the company reviews for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease. The company 2019s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset 2019s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future cash flows ( discounted at the company 2019s credit adjusted risk-free rate ) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value.

Off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7a. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. Inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar and british pound have proven to be relatively stable.

The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The currencies that create a majority of the company 2019s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar and british pound. Garmin corporation, located in shijr, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.

The guidance, which became effective for snap-on on a prospective basis at the beginning of its 2013 fiscal year, requires footnote disclosure regarding the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income by component and the line items affected in the statements of earnings.

Multiple element arrangements we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, and consulting ( multiple-element arrangements ). When vsoe of fair value does not exist for all delivered elements, we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as license revenue. Vsoe of fair value for each element is based on the price for which the element is sold separately. We determine the vsoe of fair value of each element based on historical evidence of our stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial software license arrangement. When vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered element, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such vsoe of fair value exists or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. The only exception to this guidance is when the only undelivered element is maintenance and support or other services, then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Product revenue we recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop application products 2019 revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. Our direct sales and oem sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors. We record the estimated costs of providing free technical phone support to customers for our software products. We recognize oem licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when oem partners ship products incorporating our software, provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain oem customers, we must estimate royalty.\nQuestion:what is the yearly amortization rate for the trademarks?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,409],[410,607],[608,4009],[4010,4019],[4020,4075],[4076,4083]],"num_tokens":764,"response":"The weighted average useful life of trademarks is 5 years according to the table provided.

The context does provide the rental expenses for the sale\/leaseback for the years 2000 through 2002.\n2. The calculation of the average rental expense is correct based on the figures used.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify which rental expense it is referring to. The response uses the rental expenses related to the sale\/leaseback transaction. If we consider the total rental expense (including both operating leases and sale\/leaseback), the figures would be different.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding:\n- Total rental expense for operating leases and sale\/leaseback in 2000 = $13 million + $54 million = $67 million\n- Total rental expense for 2001 = $32 million + $58 million = $90 million (or $16 million + $58 million if considering discontinued operations, but that's not directly relevant)\n- Total rental expense for 2002 = $31 million + $54 million = $85 million\n\nThus, the average total rental expense = ($67 million + $90 million + $85 million) \/ 3 = $80.67 million.\n\nSince the response directly answers the question based on a specific set of data (sale\/leaseback rental expenses) provided in the context and correctly calculates the average, but doesn't explicitly clarify that it's using the sale\/leaseback figures, we need to check if the context supports using these specific figures for the calculation.\n\nThe context supports the figures used ($54 million, $58 million, and $54 million) for the years 2000 through 2002 for the sale\/leaseback. Thus, the calculation and the figures are faithful to the context for the sale\/leaseback rental expenses.\n\n**Yes**","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No – the response only uses the sale\/leaseback rental expense figures (54, 58, 54) and ignores the separate operating‑lease rental expenses (13, 32, 31) also provided in the context.","labels_llama":0,"labels_gpt":1}

The company 2019s estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company recorded share-based compensation cost of $ 172 million, $ 179 million and $ 147 million, respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Options options issued under the eip expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:.[[\"\", \"2014\", \"2013\", \"2012\"], [\"expected term ( in years ) ( 1 )\", \"4. 80\", \"6. 08\", \"6. 02\"], [\"risk-free rate of return ( 2 )\", \"1. 3% ( 1. 3 % )\", \"0. 8% ( 0. 8 % )\", \"1. 2% ( 1. 2 % )\"], [\"expected volatility ( 3 )\", \"25. 2% ( 25. 2 % )\", \"29. 3% ( 29. 3 % )\", \"34. 9% ( 34. 9 % )\"], [\"expected dividend yield ( 4 )\", \"0. 8% ( 0. 8 % )\", \"0. 9% ( 0. 9 % )\", \"0. 9% ( 0. 9 % )\"], [\"fair value per option granted\", \"$ 44. 11\", \"$ 39. 03\", \"$ 29. 65\"]]( 1 ) beginning in fiscal 2014, assumption is based on the company 2019s historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to visa.

Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effects for the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units based on the treasury stock method. The computation of diluted earnings per common share excluded 8. 0 million, 13. 4 million, and 14. 7 million stock options for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, primarily due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of our common stock during each respective reporting period. Note 3 2013 information on business segments we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Effective december 31, 2012, we operate in five business segments: aeronautics, information systems & global solutions ( is&gs ), missiles and fire control ( mfc ), mission systems and training ( mst ), and space systems. This structure reflects the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment into the new mfc and mst business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment. In connection with this reorganization, management layers at our former electronic systems business segment and our former global training and logistics ( gtl ) business were eliminated, and the former gtl business was split between the two new business segments. In addition, operating results for sandia corporation, which manages the sandia national laboratories for the u. S. Department of energy, and our equity interest in the u. K. Atomic weapons establishment joint venture were transferred from our former electronic systems business segment to our space systems business segment. The amounts, discussion, and presentation of our business segments reflect this reorganization for all years presented in this annual report on form 10-k. The following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments: 2030 aeronautics 2013 engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. 2030 information systems & global solutions 2013 provides management services, integrated information technology solutions, and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. 2030 missiles and fire control 2013 provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; logistics and other technical services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. 2030 mission systems and training 2013 provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; unmanned technologies and platforms; ship systems integration; and military and commercial training systems. 2030 space systems 2013 engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems.

The company has recognized a full valuation allowance for the capital loss carryforwards because the company does not believe these losses are more likely than not to be recovered. The company files income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u. S. Federal, state or local or non-u. S income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007. The company has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result. The patient protection and affordable care act ( the 201cppaca 201d ) became law on march 23, 2010, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 became law on march 30, 2010, which makes various amendments to certain aspects of the ppaca ( together, the 201cacts 201d ). The ppaca effectively changes the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under medicare part d.

The total balance in the table above does not include interest and penalties of $ 242 and $ 260 as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which is recorded as a component of income tax expense. The majority of the increased tax position is attributable to temporary differences.

As of december 31, 2003, the company had 120000000 authorized shares of common stock and 450060 authorized shares of non-voting common stock. Common stock entitles the holder to one vote per share of common stock held. Non-voting common stock is convertible on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock at any time subject to a limitation on conversion to the extent such conversion would result in a stockholder, together with its affiliates, owning more than 9. 99% ( 9. 99 % ) of the outstanding shares of common stock. On march 30, 2004, the company 2019s board of directors authorized, and on november 1, 2004 the company effectuated, a one-for-three reverse stock split of shares of common stock and non-voting common stock to be effective prior to the closing of the company 2019s initial public offering. All references in these financial statements to the number of shares of common stock and non-voting common stock of the company, securities convertible or exercisable therefor and per share amounts have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the effect of the common stock reverse stock split. In 2004 and 2003, the company had 1939734 shares and 1937141 shares, respectively, of common stock that were issued to employees. Included in these amounts, in 2001, the company awarded 64001 shares and 289581 shares to employees at $. 003 and $ 3. 60, respectively, per share. The common stock subscribed was issued in 2001 in exchange for three-year promissory notes ( 64001 shares ) and eleven-year promissory notes ( 289581 shares ), which bear interest at the applicable federal rate and are collateralized by the subscribed shares. The promissory note due in 2004 was repaid on january 15, 2005. Compensation expense in relation to the excess of the fair value of such awards over the amount paid will be recorded over the vesting period. The awards vest over a period of either one and one-half or three years and are restricted as to transferability based on the vesting schedule set forth in the award agreement. The eleven-year promissory notes ( 289581 shares ) were entered into in connection with the loans of approximately $ 1042 made to the company 2019s chief executive officer in 2001.

[2] the three year average gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58, resulting in a three year gross survival ratio of 6. 4. During the second quarters of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company completed its annual ground-up asbestos reserve evaluations. As part of these evaluations, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its london market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. Based on this evaluation, the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011. During 2011, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim frequency, severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims, particularly against certain smaller, more peripheral insureds. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. The net effect of these changes in 2010 and 2009 resulted in $ 169 and $ 138 increases in net asbestos reserves, respectively. The company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually. The company divides its gross asbestos exposures into direct, assumed reinsurance and london market. The company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories: major asbestos defendants ( the 201ctop 70 201d accounts in tillinghast 2019s published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts ), which are subdivided further as: structured settlements, wellington, other major asbestos defendants, accounts with future expected exposures greater than $ 2. 5, accounts with future expected exposures less than $ 2. 5, and unallocated. 2022 structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured. 2022 the wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the 201cwellington agreement 201d dated june 19, 1985. The wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers. 2022 the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers 1 and 2, as defined by tillinghast that are not wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with the hartford. The tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims. 2022 accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $ 2. 5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants. 2022 the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account with future expected exposure of greater than $ 2. 5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $ 2. 5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.\nQuestion:what was the percentage change in the reinsurance accounts from 2009 to 2010\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,449],[450,634],[635,4580],[4581,4590],[4591,4666],[4667,4674]],"num_tokens":1021,"response":"To find the percentage change in the net asbestos reserves for the assumed reinsurance accounts from 2009 to 2010, we need to analyze the given information about reserve increases in those years.From the context:- In 2009, net asbestos reserves increased by $138 million (net effect related to direct and assumed reinsurance accounts).\n- In 2010, net asbestos reserves increased by $169 million (again related to direct and assumed reinsurance accounts).The context states the increases were driven largely by the same factors in both direct and assumed reinsurance accounts, but it does not separate how much of the increases were specifically due to assumed reinsurance alone.Since the question specifically asks about the change **in the reinsurance accounts**, and the data combines direct and assumed reinsurance increases without separate amounts, we must work with what we have:- Both years' increases include assumed reinsurance.\n- The increases are $138 million in 2009 and $169 million in 2010.Assuming the increase amounts reflect combined direct and assumed reinsurance, and since both years' increases were driven similarly by assumed reinsurance factors, the relative change likely applies similarly to the assumed reinsurance portion.**Calculating percentage change:**\\[\n\\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{169 - 138}{138} \\times 100 = \\frac{31}{138} \\times 100 \\approx 22.46\\%\n\\]**Answer:**The net asbestos reserves related to assumed reinsurance accounts increased by approximately 22.5% from 2009 to 2010.---**Reasoning Summary:**- The document only provides combined net increases for direct and assumed reinsurance together.\n- Since the increases were driven by similar factors affecting assumed reinsurance, we use total net increases as a proxy.\n- The increase from $138 million to $169 million represents about a 22.5% increase.\n- This is the best estimate for percentage change in assumed reinsurance asbestos reserves from 2009 to 2010 based on available data.","response_spans":[[0,194],[195,211],[212,453],[454,677],[678,884],[885,1003],[1004,1248],[1249,1282],[1283,1391],[1392,1402],[1403,1519],[1520,1522],[1523,1544],[1545,1981]],"labels":[{"start":1283,"end":1285,"confidence":0.5226788521,"text":"\\["},{"start":1286,"end":1319,"confidence":0.8706265688,"text":"\\text{Percentage Change} = \\frac{"},{"start":1322,"end":1324,"confidence":0.7095939517,"text":" -"},{"start":1328,"end":1389,"confidence":0.8804206252,"text":"}{138} \\times 100 = \\frac{31}{138} \\times 100 \\approx 22.46\\%"},{"start":1498,"end":1500,"confidence":0.5619642735,"text":".5"},{"start":1766,"end":1848,"confidence":0.8625283837,"text":" The increase from $138 million to $169 million represents about a 22.5% increase."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"No\n- The response assumes the percentage change in net asbestos reserves for the combined direct and assumed reinsurance accounts reflects the change in the assumed reinsurance accounts alone, which is not directly supported by the context.\n- The context does not provide separate amounts for the increases in net asbestos reserves specifically due to assumed reinsurance in 2009 and 2010.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No\n- The response treats the $138 million (2009) and $169 million (2010) increases as changes specific to the assumed reinsurance accounts, but the context only says these are net asbestos reserve increases overall (direct + assumed reinsurance), not for reinsurance alone.\n- The calculation of a 22.5 % change for “reinsurance accounts” is therefore unsupported, as the required separate reinsurance figures are not provided in the context.","labels_llama":1,"labels_gpt":1}

We concluded that we had forms of continued economic involvement in the facility, and therefore did not meet with the provisions for sale-leaseback accounting. Therefore, the lease is accounted for as a financing obligation and lease payments will be attributed to ( 1 ) a reduction of the principal financing obligation; ( 2 ) imputed interest expense; and ( 3 ) land lease expense ( which is considered an operating lease and a component of cost of goods sold and operating expenses ) representing an imputed cost to lease the underlying land of the building. In addition, the underlying building asset is depreciated over the building 2019s estimated useful life of 30 years. At the conclusion of the initial lease term, we will de-recognize both the net book values of the asset and the remaining financing obligation. Purchase commitments we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations to third-party contract manufacturers, who procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply. We issue purchase orders to our contract manufacturers for finished product and a significant portion of these orders consist of firm non- cancelable commitments. In addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are non-cancelable, including integrated circuits, which are consigned to our contract manufacturers. As of december 31, 2015, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments of $ 43. 9 million to our contract manufacturers and suppliers. We have provided restricted deposits to our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors to secure our obligations to purchase inventory. We had $ 2. 3 million in restricted deposits as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. Restricted deposits are classified in other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees we have entered into agreements with some of our direct customers and channel partners that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. We have at our option and expense the ability to repair any infringement, replace product with a non-infringing equivalent-in-function product or refund our customers.\nQuestion:what is the current portion of the present value of lease obligations?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,297],[298,751],[752,3321],[3322,3331],[3332,3401],[3402,3409]],"num_tokens":751,"response":"From the context, the present value of the lease obligations as of December 31, 2015 is stated as $42,546 (thousands).

We believe that cash flows from operations and cash provided by short-term and committed revolver borrowings, when necessary, will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating requirements, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditures. The following summarizes our cash flows:.[[\"( $ in millions )\", \"2010\", \"2009\", \"2008\"], [\"cash flows provided by ( used in ) operating activities including discontinued operations\", \"$ 515. 2\", \"$ 559. 7\", \"$ 627. 6\"], [\"cash flows provided by ( used in ) investing activities including discontinued operations\", \"-110. 2 ( 110. 2 )\", \"-581. 4 ( 581. 4 )\", \"-418. 0 ( 418. 0 )\"], [\"cash flows provided by ( used in ) financing activities\", \"-459. 6 ( 459. 6 )\", \"100. 8\", \"-205. 5 ( 205. 5 )\"]]Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 included a use of $ 250 million related to a change in accounting for our accounts receivable securitization program. At december 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $ 250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the company 2019s adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective january 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at december 31, 2010, resulting in a $ 250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at december 31, 2010. Excluding the $ 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $ 765. 2 million in 2010 compared to $ 559. 7 million in 2009 and $ 627. 6 million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $ 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement. Management performance measures the following financial measurements are on a non-u. S. Gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report. Non-u. S. Gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u. S. Gaap. A presentation of earnings in accordance with u. S. Gaap is available in item 8 of this report.

Free cash flow is not a defined term under u. S. Gaap, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.

Retail marketing ssa, our wholly-owned subsidiary, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the speedway ae and superamerica ae brands. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. Ssa retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. As of december 31, 2008, ssa had 1617 retail outlets in nine states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2008. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $ 2838 million in 2008, $ 2796 million in 2007 and $ 2706 million in 2006. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of ssa markets, usually with the highest demand during the summer driving season.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:At its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $ 440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension benefits: $987 million  \n  - International qualified and non-qualified pension benefits: $205 million  The approximate U.S. pension benefits for 2015 would be similar to 2016, given the steady incremental pattern (from 2016 onward, the payments increase slightly each year).Assuming for estimation:- U.S. pension benefits 2015 ≈ $987 million (similar to 2016)- International pension benefits 2015 ≈ $205 millionHence, total pension benefits ≈ $987m + $205m = $1,192 million**Step 3: Calculate approximate contribution ratios for 2015 and 2014**Since the contributions are to both U.S. and international plans combined, use total contributions and total pension benefits:2015 contribution to pension plans \/ 2015 pension benefits ≈ $264m \/ $1,192m ≈ 0.2215 (or 22.15%)2014 contribution to pension plans \/ estimated 2014 pension benefitsWe don't have 2014 pension benefits explicitly, but using 2015 as approximate reference (2015 pension benefits ≈ $1,192m), we can approximate similarly for 2014 benefits as slightly less (around $1,170m, given the incremental increase by year in later years).So approximate 2014 pension benefits ≈ $1,170 million2014 contribution ratio ≈ $210m \/ $1,170m ≈ 0.1795 (or 17.95%)**Step 4: Compute the ratio of 2015 contribution ratio to 2014 contribution ratio**= 0.2215 \/ 0.1795 ≈ 1.234**Answer:**  \nThe ratio of the company contribution to the U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension benefits for 2015 compared to 2014 is approximately **1.23**, meaning the company contributed about 23% more relative to pension benefits in 2015 than in 2014.","response_spans":[[0,242],[243,284],[285,435],[436,581],[582,651],[652,697],[698,814],[815,988],[989,1159],[1160,1183],[1184,1244],[1245,1296],[1297,1358],[1359,1429],[1430,1555],[1556,1652],[1653,1720],[1721,1979],[1980,2032],[2033,2094],[2095,2177],[2178,2202],[2203,2461]],"labels":[{"start":1556,"end":1653,"confidence":0.7389981747,"text":"2015 contribution to pension plans \/ 2015 pension benefits ≈ $264m \/ $1,192m ≈ 0.2215 (or 22.15%)"},{"start":1994,"end":2018,"confidence":0.5349661112,"text":" 2014 pension benefits ≈"},{"start":2018,"end":2097,"confidence":0.8074992299,"text":" $1,170 million2014 contribution ratio ≈ $210m \/ $1,170m ≈ 0.1795 (or 17.95%)**"},{"start":2112,"end":2116,"confidence":0.5674127936,"text":" the"},{"start":2143,"end":2149,"confidence":0.5364589691,"text":" ratio"},{"start":2181,"end":2188,"confidence":0.558328867,"text":".2215 \/"},{"start":2190,"end":2200,"confidence":0.5845860243,"text":".1795 ≈ 1."},{"start":2340,"end":2462,"confidence":0.8712636828,"text":" approximately **1.23**, meaning the company contributed about 23% more relative to pension benefits in 2015 than in 2014."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"No\n- The response assumes the U.S. pension benefits for 2015 are similar to 2016, but the context does not provide 2015 benefits directly.\n- The response estimates 2014 pension benefits without direct evidence from the context.\n- The actual U.S. pension benefits for 2015 and 2014 are not given in the context, making the direct calculation of the ratio impossible.\n- The context only provides combined contributions for U.S. and international pension plans, not separate U.S. contributions.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No – the response contains several unsupported elements:\n- Uses 2016 benefit payments as a proxy for 2015 and 2014 US pension benefits (the context provides no 2015\/2014 benefit data).\n- Assumes US pension benefits are equal to the 2016 figure and that 2014 benefits are “slightly less” (no such figures are given).\n- Calculates contribution‑to‑benefit ratios and a comparative ratio (≈1.23) based on these unprovided estimates.","labels_llama":1,"labels_gpt":1}

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:With respect to our business operations, we are standardizing certain core business processes, primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology, and driving automation of these business processes. We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 400 million to $ 450 million over the four-year period ending december 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $ 289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $ 156 million in 2010 and $ 133 million in 2011. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: ( in millions ) employee-related real estate consolidation information technology costs total.[[\"( in millions )\", \"employee-related costs\", \"real estate consolidation\", \"information technology costs\", \"total\"], [\"2010\", \"$ 105\", \"$ 51\", \"\", \"$ 156\"], [\"2011\", \"85\", \"7\", \"$ 41\", \"133\"], [\"total\", \"$ 190\", \"$ 58\", \"$ 41\", \"$ 289\"]]The employee-related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services. Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above-described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1400 employees, or approximately 5% ( 5 % ) of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of december 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $ 86 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run-rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $ 400 million to $ 450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre-tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $ 575 million to $ 625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 160 million in 2015. These annual pre-tax run-rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program.

See notes 6 through 8 for further information about level 3 financial assets ( including information about unrealized gains and losses related to level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities, and transfers in and out of level 3 ). Note 6. Cash instruments cash instruments include u. S. Government and agency obligations, non-u. S. Government and agency obligations, mortgage-backed loans and securities, corporate loans and debt securities, equity securities, investments in funds at nav, and other non-derivative financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased. See below for the types of cash instruments included in each level of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine their fair values. See note 5 for an overview of the firm 2019s fair value measurement policies. Level 1 cash instruments level 1 cash instruments include certain money market instruments, u. S. Government obligations, most non-u. S. Government obligations, certain government agency obligations, certain corporate debt securities and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. Level 2 cash instruments level 2 cash instruments include most money market instruments, most government agency obligations, certain non-u. S. Government obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate loans and debt securities, most state and municipal obligations, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, commodities and certain lending commitments. Valuations of level 2 cash instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations ( e. G., indicative or firm ) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash instruments ( i ) if the cash instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and\/or ( ii ) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. Level 3 cash instruments level 3 cash instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales of financial assets. Valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below: loans and securities backed by commercial real estate. Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination.

Moreover, the historical operations of blockbuster materially changed during the periods preceding the acquisition as a result of blockbuster inc. 2019s bankruptcy proceedings, and any historical pro forma information would not prove useful in assessing our post acquisition earnings and cash flows. The cost of goods sold on a unit basis for blockbuster in the current period was lower-than-historical costs. The carrying values in the current period of the rental library and merchandise inventories ( 201cblockbuster inventory 201d ) were reduced to their estimated fair value due to the application of purchase accounting. This impact on cost of goods sold on a unit basis will diminish in the future as we purchase new blockbuster inventory. 10. Spectrum investments terrestar transaction gamma acquisition l. L. C. ( 201cgamma 201d ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network, entered into the terrestar transaction on june 14, 2011. On july 7, 2011, the u. S. Bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approved the asset purchase agreement with terrestar and we subsequently paid $ 1. 345 billion of the cash purchase price. Dish network is a party to the asset purchase agreement solely with respect to certain guaranty obligations. We have paid all but $ 30 million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction, which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction, or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011. We expect that the terrestar transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using purchase price accounting. We also expect to allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and\/or cost approach. We expect the purchase price of the terrestar assets to be allocated to, among other things, spectrum and satellites.\nQuestion:for the terrestar acquisition what will the final cash purchase price be in millions paid upon closing?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,423],[424,723],[724,3841],[3842,3851],[3852,3954],[3955,3962]],"num_tokens":833,"response":"The context states that Dish Network has already paid $1.345 billion (i.e., $1,345 million) of the cash purchase price for the Terrestar transaction and that all but $30 million of the purchase price has been paid.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Note 17 2014 sales-type leases and financing receivables in april 2017, in conjunction with the implementation of a new 201cgo-to-market 201d business model for the company's u. S. Dispensing business within the medication management solutions ( 201cmms 201d ) unit of the medical segment, the company amended the terms of certain customer leases for dispensing equipment within the mms unit. The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 840, \"leases\", as the non- cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% ( 75 % ) of the equipment 2019s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% ( 90 % ) of the equipment 2019s fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term. Accordingly, most amended lease contracts were classified as operating leases beginning in april 2017. The change in lease classification resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in fiscal year 2017 of $ 748 million, which was recorded in other operating expense, net. Beginning april 1, 2017, revenue associated with these modified contracts has been recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with depreciation on the reinstated leased assets. The company's consolidated financial results in 2018 and 2017 were not materially impacted by the financing receivables remaining subsequent to the lease modification discussed above.

Since the only mentioned interest rate is an implicit 7.458% and there is no explicit information on others, the best estimate is to apply 7.458% to the $760 million 2018 maturity.\n2. If the entire $760 million were subject to this implicit interest rate (which might not be exactly true, but no contrary info is given), then the interest amount for 2018 would be:Interest = Principal × Interest rate  \nInterest = $760,000,000 × 7.458%  \nInterest ≈ $760,000,000 × 0.07458  \nInterest ≈ $56,680,8003. However, since the maturities represent repayment of principal due rather than the interest expense, this amount ($760 million) is the principal maturing, not the interest accruing or payable on that principal for the year.4. Without further information on the interest expense or coupon payments for 2018, the precise interest amount applied to the 2018 maturities cannot be definitively calculated from the data given.**Conclusion:**The document does not provide a direct figure for the interest applied to the annual long-term debt maturities in 2018. Although an implicit interest rate of 7.458% is mentioned for one note, it is unclear if or how it applies to the entire 2018 maturities of $760 million.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 2013 ( continued ) restricted stock awards and units restricted stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that the compensation committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other limitations. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock awards performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Vesting of the awards is dependent on devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. In order for awards to vest, the performance target must be met in the first year, and if met, recipients are entitled to dividends on the awards over the remaining service vesting period. If the performance target and service period requirements are not met, the award does not vest. Devon estimates the fair values of the awards as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing devon 2019s tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified two- or three- year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200% ( 200 % ) of the units granted depending on devon 2019s tsr as compared to the peer group on the vesting date. At the end of the vesting period, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: ( i ) a risk-free interest rate based on u. S. Treasury rates as of the grant date; ( ii ) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of devon and the designated peer group; and ( iii ) an estimated ranking of devon among the designated peer group.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. Credit default swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit indices, baskets and tranches. Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure. Total return swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. Credit options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:At its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $ 440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:American tower corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 19. Commitments and contingencies litigation 2014the company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the company 2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Tristar litigation 2014the company was involved in several lawsuits against tristar investors llp and its affiliates ( 201ctristar 201d ) in various states regarding single tower sites where tristar had taken land interests under the company 2019s owned or managed sites and the company believes tristar induced the landowner to breach obligations to the company. In addition, on february 16, 2012, tristar brought a federal action against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of texas ( the 201cdistrict court 201d ), in which tristar principally alleged that the company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with tristar for land under the company 2019s owned or managed sites. On january 22, 2013, the company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against tristar and certain of its employees, denying tristar 2019s claims and asserting that tristar engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: ( i ) entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and ( ii ) making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both tristar and the company. Pursuant to a settlement agreement dated july 9, 2014, all pending state and federal actions between the company and tristar were dismissed with prejudice and without payment of damages. Lease obligations 2014the company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to cpi or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the company 2019s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the company will renew the leases.

The majority of the accrual is expected to be paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Cash payments for the twelve months ended december 3, 1999 related to the fiscal 1998 restructuring were $ 0. 7 million, $ 3. 6 million, and $ 0. 4 million for severance and related charges, lease termination costs, and canceled contracts costs, respectively. In addition, adjustments related to the fiscal 1998 restructuring were made during the year, which consisted of $ 0. 4 million related to estimated lease termination costs and $ 0. 3 mil- lion related to other charges. Included in the accrual balance as of november 27, 1998 were lease termination costs related to previously announced restructuring programs in fiscal 1994 and 1995. Cash payments for the twelve months ended december 3, 1999 related to both restructuring programs were $ 1. 5 million. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded adjustments to the accrual balance of approximately $ 1. 2 million related to these programs. An adjustment of $ 0. 6 million was made in the third quarter of fiscal 1999 due to the company 2019s success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified. In addition, $ 0. 6 million was reduced from the restructuring accrual relating to expired lease termination costs for two facilities resulting from the merger with frame in fiscal 1995. As of december 3, 1999 no accrual balances remain related to the aldus and frame mergers. Other charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded other charges of $ 8. 4 million that were unusual in nature. These charges included $ 2. 0 million associated with the cancellation of a contract and $ 2. 2 million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program. Additionally, the company incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling $ 2. 6 million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of $ 1. 6 million to assist in the restructuring of the company 2019s operations.\nQuestion:what is the net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 1999?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,602],[603,851],[852,3307],[3308,3317],[3318,3404],[3405,3412]],"num_tokens":840,"response":"To find the net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 1999, we look at the beginning and ending accrual balances along with charges, payments, and adjustments.From the table:- Accrued balance at November 27, 1998: $8,867 thousand  \n- Total charges during 1999: $2,014 thousand  \n- Cash payments during 1999: $(6,221) thousand (a decrease in accrual)  \n- Adjustments during 1999: $(1,874) thousand (a decrease in accrual)  \n- Accrued balance at December 3, 1999: $772 thousand  The net change in the accrual balance = Ending balance - Beginning balance  \n= $772 thousand - $8,867 thousand  \n= $(8,095) thousand (a decrease)Alternatively, the net change can also be viewed as the sum of total charges minus cash payments and adjustments:  \nNet change = Total charges - Cash payments - Adjustments  \n= $2,014 - $6,221 - $1,874  \n= $2,014 - $8,095  \n= $(6,081) thousandThis difference suggests the adjustments also affect the balance besides cash payments, resulting in a net reduction.However, since the ending balance is $772 thousand, much lower than the starting $8,867 thousand, the overall net decrease in accruals during 1999 was approximately **$8.1 million**.**Answer:** The net change in the accrual related to restructurings during 1999 was a decrease of about $8.1 million.","response_spans":[[0,186],[187,201],[202,504],[505,649],[650,892],[893,1009],[1010,1191],[1192,1308]],"labels":[{"start":365,"end":376,"confidence":0.6054247022,"text":" in accrual"},{"start":436,"end":439,"confidence":0.5264474154,"text":" in"},{"start":857,"end":862,"confidence":0.5803928971,"text":"2,014"},{"start":874,"end":893,"confidence":0.816213429,"text":"= $(6,081) thousand"}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response accurately calculates the net change in the balance of accrual related to restructurings during 1999 using the provided data in the context.

Our international operations' revenues and expenses are generally denominated in local currency, which limits the economic exposure to foreign exchange risk in those jurisdictions. We do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for trading purposes. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure to intercompany loans. As of december 31, 2012, the notional amount of these derivatives was approximately $ 115. 6 million and the fair value was nominal. These derivatives are intended to hedge the foreign exchange risks related to intercompany loans, but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nQuestion:what is the unfavorable impact in the operating expense in 2012 resulting from a stronger u.s . dollar?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,145],[146,402],[403,1661],[1662,1671],[1672,1774],[1775,1782]],"num_tokens":457,"response":"The context states that in 2012, revenue included $100.8 million and operating income included $9.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to 2011.Operating income is revenue minus operating expenses.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Home equity repurchase obligations pnc 2019s repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans\/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition of national city. Pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines\/loans is reported in the non- strategic assets portfolio segment. Loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans pnc sold to the investors are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan 2019s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. We investigate every investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to settlement with that investor. Indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor 2019s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor, we typically respond to home equity indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. Most home equity sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests. Investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. In connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction. The following table details the unpaid principal balance of our unresolved home equity indemnification and repurchase claims at december 31, 2012 and december 31, 2011, respectively.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, its results have been included in the consolidated financial statements since march 27, 2006. Alcan packaging on march 28, 2006, ball acquired north american plastic bottle container assets from alcan packaging ( alcan ) for $ 184. 7 million cash. The acquired assets included two plastic container manufacturing plants in the u. S. And one in canada, as well as certain manufacturing equipment and other assets from other alcan facilities. This acquisition strengthens the company 2019s plastic container business and complements its food container business. The acquired business primarily manufactures and sells barrier polypropylene plastic bottles used in food packaging and, to a lesser extent, barrier pet plastic bottles used for beverages and food. The acquired operations formed part of ball 2019s plastic packaging, americas, segment during 2006. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, its results have been included in the consolidated financial statements since march 28, 2006. Following is a summary of the net assets acquired in the u. S. Can and alcan transactions using preliminary fair values. The valuation by management of certain assets, including identification and valuation of acquired fixed assets and intangible assets, and of liabilities, including development and assessment of associated costs of consolidation and integration plans, is still in process and, therefore, the actual fair values may vary from the preliminary estimates. Final valuations will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2007.

Due to the material ongoing modifications of the business, management has determined that insufficient information exists to accurately develop meaningful historical pro forma financial information. Moreover, the historical operations of blockbuster materially changed during the periods preceding the acquisition as a result of blockbuster inc. 2019s bankruptcy proceedings, and any historical pro forma information would not prove useful in assessing our post acquisition earnings and cash flows. The cost of goods sold on a unit basis for blockbuster in the current period was lower-than-historical costs. The carrying values in the current period of the rental library and merchandise inventories ( 201cblockbuster inventory 201d ) were reduced to their estimated fair value due to the application of purchase accounting. This impact on cost of goods sold on a unit basis will diminish in the future as we purchase new blockbuster inventory. 10. Spectrum investments terrestar transaction gamma acquisition l. L. C. ( 201cgamma 201d ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network, entered into the terrestar transaction on june 14, 2011. On july 7, 2011, the u. S. Bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approved the asset purchase agreement with terrestar and we subsequently paid $ 1. 345 billion of the cash purchase price. Dish network is a party to the asset purchase agreement solely with respect to certain guaranty obligations. We have paid all but $ 30 million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction, which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction, or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011. We expect that the terrestar transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using purchase price accounting.

simplest is just to consider:Hard assets = Cash + Current assets + Property and equipment = $289,982  \nTotal purchase price = $233,584  The subtraction of liabilities is already factored in the total purchase price, so the hard assets percentage of purchase price is:Hard assets (net of liabilities) = $289,982 - allocation of liabilities.Assuming liabilities mostly relate to current liabilities ($86,080), which relate mostly to current assets and possibly some to property and equipment.If we subtract $86,080 from current assets and cash portion:- Cash + Current assets = $107,061 + 153,258 = 260,319  \n- After subtracting liabilities: 260,319 - 86,080 = 174,239  \n- Adding property and equipment: 174,239 + 28,663 = 202,902  Now calculate hard assets %:  \n202,902 \/ 233,584 = 0.869 or 86.9%**Final Answer:**  \nHard assets represented approximately **87%** of the total Blockbuster purchase price.---### Summary:- Hard assets considered: cash, current assets, property and equipment  \n- After deducting current liabilities attributed primarily to current assets and cash, hard assets amount to roughly $202.9 million out of $233.6 million total purchase price  \n- This equates to about **87%** of the total purchase price.**Answer:** Hard assets were approximately **87%** of the total Blockbuster purchase price.","response_spans":[[0,230],[231,290],[291,516],[517,608],[609,705],[706,862],[863,1026],[1027,1225],[1226,1446],[1447,1486],[1487,1811],[1812,1921],[1922,1979],[1980,2198],[2199,2301],[2302,2351],[2352,2409],[2410,2480],[2481,2596],[2597,2703],[2704,2834],[2835,2906],[2907,3057],[3058,3117],[3118,3297],[3298,3362],[3363,3468],[3469,3471],[3472,3483],[3484,3793],[3794,3884]],"labels":[{"start":636,"end":677,"confidence":0.8112826347,"text":"likely includes inventories, receivables)"},{"start":773,"end":811,"confidence":0.7190167904,"text":" intangible or less tangible in nature"},{"start":815,"end":863,"confidence":0.7294521928,"text":" they are generally excluded from \"hard assets.\""},{"start":1205,"end":1226,"confidence":0.6518799663,"text":" approximately 124.2%"},{"start":1747,"end":1750,"confidence":0.5441710353,"text":"664"},{"start":1752,"end":1755,"confidence":0.5185775757,"text":" 86"},{"start":2408,"end":2409,"confidence":0.561424613,"text":"7"},{"start":2981,"end":2988,"confidence":0.5104701519,"text":" relate"},{"start":2998,"end":3057,"confidence":0.7240103483,"text":" current assets and possibly some to property and equipment"},{"start":3164,"end":3168,"confidence":0.5597059131,"text":" 260"},{"start":3207,"end":3234,"confidence":0.7579779625,"text":" 260,319 - 86,080 = 174,239"},{"start":3269,"end":3296,"confidence":0.7451543212,"text":" 174,239 + 28,663 = 202,902"},{"start":3298,"end":3326,"confidence":0.6644856334,"text":"Now calculate hard assets %:"},{"start":3329,"end":3363,"confidence":0.8276757002,"text":"202,902 \/ 233,584 = 0.869 or 86.9%"},{"start":3648,"end":3692,"confidence":0.8130732775,"text":" assets amount to roughly $202.9 million out"},{"start":3697,"end":3731,"confidence":0.7161328197,"text":"233.6 million total purchase price"}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response is faithful to the context, as it accurately extracts relevant information from the provided table and performs a reasonable calculation to determine the percentage of hard assets relative to the total Blockbuster purchase price.

In our opinion, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Operating taxes we define operating taxes as taxes that are unrelated to income taxes, such as sales, property, value-add and other business taxes. During the course of operations, we must interpret the meaning of various operating tax matters in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Taxing authorities in those various jurisdictions may arrive at different interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to such operating tax matters, which could result in the payment of additional taxes in those jurisdictions. As of may 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not have liabilities for contingencies related to operating tax items based on management 2019s best estimate given our history with similar matters and interpretations of current laws and regulations. Bin\/ica agreements we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks 2019 identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ( 201cbin 201d ) for visa transactions and interbank card association ( 201cica 201d ) number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of may 31, 2013. Our canadian visa sponsorship, which was originally obtained through a canadian financial institution, expired in march 2011. We have filed an application with the office of the superintendent of financial institutions canada ( 201cosfi 201d ) for the formation of a wholly owned loan company in canada which would serve as our financial institution sponsor.

The $40 million cash received relates to stock options exercise, not ESPP.Given the shares are issued at 85% of market price, average price per share paid = 85% * average market price.We lack the exact average market price, but we can estimate the average purchase price using the known numbers:- The company recognized $9 million in compensation expense related to the ESPP in 2015.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:At its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $ 440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers.

Purchase obligations are the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on december 30, 2006; these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the normal course of our manufacturing business. Off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7a. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. Inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin 2019s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar and british pound have proven to be relatively stable. However, periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u. S. Dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The currencies that create a majority of the company 2019s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar and british pound. Garmin corporation, located in shijr, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary 2019s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u. S. Dollars. The td\/usd exchange rate decreased 0. 7% ( 0. 7 % ) during 2006, which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative $ 1. 2 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and a net foreign currency loss of $ 3. 1 million at garmin corporation during 2006.\nQuestion:what is the decrease observed in the operating leases with payments due to 3-5 years and payments due to more than 5 years?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,298],[299,729],[730,3581],[3582,3591],[3592,3714],[3715,3722]],"num_tokens":822,"response":"From the given context, the payments due under operating leases are broken down as follows:- Payments due 3-5 years: $6,040  \n- Payments due more than 5 years: $15,477The question asks for the \"decrease observed in the operating leases with payments due to 3-5 years and payments due to more than 5 years.\"Since the context provides just the values of payments due in these periods but does not provide previous periods or comparative data, there is no explicit information on any decrease in these amounts.Therefore, based on the provided data, **no decrease can be determined** because the context does not give prior numbers or indicate any reduction in these payments.**Answer:**  \nThere is no information provided in the context to determine a decrease in operating lease payments due in the 3-5 years and more than 5 years periods.

Number of shares issued to U.K. employees in 2015: **2,779 shares**  \n2. The shares are purchased after a 3-year period under the employee share purchase plan, which is similar to the U.S. plan.However, the context does not explicitly state the price at which the U.K. employees purchase shares. The only explicit pricing detail is for the U.S. employee share purchase plan, where shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or last day of each 6-month period.Since the U.K. plan is described as \"similar\" to the U.S. plan, and no other price or discount is specified, it is reasonable to assume that the U.K. employees also receive a similar discount (85%) off the fair market value at purchase.Unfortunately, the context does not provide the actual fair market value of the shares in 2015. Therefore, we cannot compute a specific dollar average share price based on the data given.**Conclusion:**  \n- The exact average share price for shares issued to U.K. employees in 2015 cannot be determined from the given information because the fair market value of the shares is not provided.\n- If fair market value were known, the average price paid would be approximately **85% of that fair market value**, since the plan is similar to the U.S. plan and offers an 85% discount.**Answer:**  \nThe context does not provide sufficient data to calculate the average share price for the 2,779 shares issued to U.K. employees in 2015. However, since the U.K. employee share purchase plan is similar to the U.S. plan, it is likely that shares were purchased at 85% of the fair market value at the time of purchase.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Management 2019s discussion and analysis balance sheet analysis and metrics as of december 2013, total assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition were $ 911. 51 billion, a decrease of $ 27. 05 billion from december 2012. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in financial instruments owned, at fair value of $ 67. 89 billion, primarily due to decreases in u. S. Government and federal agency obligations, non-u. S. Government and agency obligations, derivatives and commodities, and a decrease in other assets of $ 17. 11 billion, primarily due to the sale of a majority stake in our americas reinsurance business in april 2013. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in collateralized agreements of $ 48. 07 billion, due to firm and client activity. As of december 2013, total liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition were $ 833. 04 billion, a decrease of $ 29. 80 billion from december 2012. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other liabilities and accrued expenses of $ 26. 35 billion, primarily due to the sale of a majority stake in both our americas reinsurance business in april 2013 and our european insurance business in december 2013, and a decrease in collateralized financings of $ 9. 24 billion, primarily due to firm financing activities. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in payables to customers and counterparties of $ 10. 21 billion. As of december 2013, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $ 164. 78 billion, which was 5% ( 5 % ) higher and 4% ( 4 % ) higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december 2013, respectively. The increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2013 was primarily due to an increase in client activity at the end of the period. As of december 2012, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $ 171. 81 billion, which was essentially unchanged and 3% ( 3 % ) higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december 2012, respectively. The increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2012 was primarily due to an increase in firm financing activities at the end of the period. The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as u. S. Government and federal agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations through collateralized financing activities.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Home equity repurchase obligations pnc 2019s repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans\/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition of national city. Pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines\/loans is reported in the non- strategic assets portfolio segment. Loan covenants and representations and warranties were established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that loans pnc sold to the investors are of sufficient investment quality. Key aspects of such covenants and representations and warranties include the loan 2019s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established for the transaction, including underwriting standards, delivery of all required loan documents to the investor or its designated party, sufficient collateral valuation, and the validity of the lien securing the loan. As a result of alleged breaches of these contractual obligations, investors may request pnc to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans. We investigate every investor claim on a loan by loan basis to determine the existence of a legitimate claim, and that all other conditions for indemnification or repurchase have been met prior to settlement with that investor. Indemnifications for loss or loan repurchases typically occur when, after review of the claim, we agree insufficient evidence exists to dispute the investor 2019s claim that a breach of a loan covenant and representation and warranty has occurred, such breach has not been cured, and the effect of such breach is deemed to have had a material and adverse effect on the value of the transferred loan. Depending on the sale agreement and upon proper notice from the investor, we typically respond to home equity indemnification and repurchase requests within 60 days, although final resolution of the claim may take a longer period of time. Most home equity sale agreements do not provide for penalties or other remedies if we do not respond timely to investor indemnification or repurchase requests. Investor indemnification or repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases; however, on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors. In connection with pooled settlements, we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction.

The gross other-than-temporary impairment ( 201cotti 201d ) and the noncredit portion of otti, which was or had been previously recorded through other comprehensive income ( loss ), are shown in the table below ( dollars in millions ): year ended december 31, 2012 2011.[[\"\", \"year ended december 31 2012\", \"2011\"], [\"other-than-temporary impairment ( 201cotti 201d )\", \"$ -19. 8 ( 19. 8 )\", \"$ -9. 2 ( 9. 2 )\"], [\"less: noncredit portion of otti recognized into ( out of ) other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( before tax )\", \"2. 9\", \"-5. 7 ( 5. 7 )\"], [\"net impairment\", \"$ -16. 9 ( 16. 9 )\", \"$ -14. 9 ( 14. 9 )\"]]Provision for loan losses provision for loan losses decreased 20% ( 20 % ) to $ 354. 6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease in provision for loan losses was driven primarily by improving credit trends, as evidenced by the lower levels of delinquent loans in the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, and loan portfolio run-off. The decrease was partially offset by $ 50 million in charge-offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings during the third quarter of 2012, with approximately 80% ( 80 % ) related to prior years. We utilize third party loan servicers to obtain bankruptcy data on our borrowers and during the third quarter of 2012, we identified an increase in bankruptcies reported by one specific servicer. In researching this increase, we discovered that the servicer had not been reporting historical bankruptcy data on a timely basis. As a result, we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data. Through this additional process, approximately $ 90 million of loans were identified in which servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to us, approximately 90% ( 90 % ) of which were current at the end of the third quarter of 2012. As a result, these loans were written down to the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs, or approximately $ 40 million, during the third quarter of 2012. These charge-offs resulted in an increase to provision for loan losses of $ 50 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. The provision for loan losses has declined four consecutive years, down 78% ( 78 % ) from its peak of $ 1. 6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2008. We expect provision for loan losses to continue to decline over the long term, although it is subject to variability in any given quarter.\nQuestion:what was the change in the net impairment from 2011 to 2012\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,736],[737,1083],[1084,3004],[3005,3014],[3015,3073],[3074,3081]],"num_tokens":790,"response":"The net impairment recognized was $14.9 million in 2011 and $16.9 million in 2012.**Calculation of change:**  \n$16.9 million (2012) - $14.9 million (2011) = $2.0 million increase**Reasoning:**  \nFrom the context, net impairment increased by $2.0 million from 2011 to 2012 due to continued deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the non-agency CMO portfolio.**Final answer:**  \nThe net impairment increased by $2.0 million from 2011 to 2012.","response_spans":[[0,81],[82,177],[178,393],[394,476]],"labels":[],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response accurately reflects the information provided in the context.

The following table displays gross environmental reserves and other statistics by category as of december 31, 2011. Summary of environmental reserves as of december 31, 2011.[[\"\", \"total reserves\"], [\"gross [1] [2]\", \"\"], [\"direct\", \"$ 271\"], [\"assumed reinsurance\", \"39\"], [\"london market\", \"57\"], [\"total\", \"367\"], [\"ceded\", \"-47 ( 47 )\"], [\"net\", \"$ 320\"]][1] the one year gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58, resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of 6. 4. [2] the three year average gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58, resulting in a three year gross survival ratio of 6. 4. During the second quarters of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company completed its annual ground-up asbestos reserve evaluations. As part of these evaluations, the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability, as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its london market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. Based on this evaluation, the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011. During 2011, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim frequency, severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims, particularly against certain smaller, more peripheral insureds. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. The net effect of these changes in 2010 and 2009 resulted in $ 169 and $ 138 increases in net asbestos reserves, respectively. The company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually. The company divides its gross asbestos exposures into direct, assumed reinsurance and london market. The company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories: major asbestos defendants ( the 201ctop 70 201d accounts in tillinghast 2019s published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts ), which are subdivided further as: structured settlements, wellington, other major asbestos defendants, accounts with future expected exposures greater than $ 2. 5, accounts with future expected exposures less than $ 2. 5, and unallocated. 2022 structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured. 2022 the wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the 201cwellington agreement 201d dated june 19, 1985. The wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers. 2022 the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers 1 and 2, as defined by tillinghast that are not wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with the hartford. The tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims. 2022 accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $ 2. 5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants. 2022 the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account with future expected exposure of greater than $ 2. 5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $ 2. 5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.\nQuestion:of the total net reserves , what portion is related to london market?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,449],[450,634],[635,4580],[4581,4590],[4591,4659],[4660,4667]],"num_tokens":1012,"response":"To determine the portion of the total net reserves related to the London market, we start with the provided data:- Gross reserves for the London market: $57  \n- Total gross reserves: $367  \n- Total net reserves: $320  \n- Ceded reserves: -$47 (which is the amount the company expects to recover from reinsurers)Since net reserves = gross reserves - ceded reserves, and the net amount for the company overall is $320.However, the data does not provide explicit ceded amounts split by category (direct, assumed reinsurance, London market). Without the specific ceded figures for the London market, we cannot precisely calculate the net reserves for that segment.Given that, if we assume the ceded reserves are distributed proportionally across the categories based on their gross reserves, then the London market's share of the net reserves can be estimated as follows:1.

We are dependent on two key domestic suppliers of locomotives 2013 due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, high barriers to entry face potential new suppliers. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations.

The company has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result. The patient protection and affordable care act ( the 201cppaca 201d ) became law on march 23, 2010, and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 became law on march 30, 2010, which makes various amendments to certain aspects of the ppaca ( together, the 201cacts 201d ). The ppaca effectively changes the tax treatment of federal subsidies paid to sponsors of retiree health benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefits under medicare part d. The acts effectively make the subsidy payments taxable in tax years beginning after december 31, 2012 and as a result, the company followed its original accounting for the underfunded status of the other postretirement benefits for the medicare part d adjustment and recorded a reduction in deferred tax assets and an increase in its regulatory assets amounting to $ 6432.

Based on this evaluation, the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011. During 2011, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim frequency, severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims, particularly against certain smaller, more peripheral insureds. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. The net effect of these changes in 2010 and 2009 resulted in $ 169 and $ 138 increases in net asbestos reserves, respectively. The company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually. The company divides its gross asbestos exposures into direct, assumed reinsurance and london market. The company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories: major asbestos defendants ( the 201ctop 70 201d accounts in tillinghast 2019s published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts ), which are subdivided further as: structured settlements, wellington, other major asbestos defendants, accounts with future expected exposures greater than $ 2. 5, accounts with future expected exposures less than $ 2. 5, and unallocated. 2022 structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured. 2022 the wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the 201cwellington agreement 201d dated june 19, 1985. The wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers. 2022 the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers 1 and 2, as defined by tillinghast that are not wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with the hartford. The tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims. 2022 accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $ 2. 5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants. 2022 the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies. An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account with future expected exposure of greater than $ 2. 5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $ 2. 5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.\nQuestion:what was the percentage change in the reinsurance accounts from 2009 to 2010\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,449],[450,634],[635,4580],[4581,4590],[4591,4666],[4667,4674]],"num_tokens":1021,"response":"To find the percentage change in the reinsurance accounts from 2009 to 2010, we need to use the information about the increases in net asbestos reserves specifically attributed to assumed reinsurance accounts for those years.From the context:- The net effect of changes in 2010 resulted in an increase in net asbestos reserves by $169.\n- The net effect of changes in 2009 resulted in an increase in net asbestos reserves by $138.\n- The context states that the unfavorable development on assumed reinsurance accounts was driven largely by the same factors experienced by direct policyholders in both years.Since the question focuses on reinsurance accounts, and the increases ($169 in 2010 and $138 in 2009) are the total net increases in asbestos reserves reflecting both direct and assumed reinsurance accounts combined, we will assume these figures represent the net asbestos reserve changes including reinsurance.Because the question asks for the percentage change in reinsurance accounts from 2009 to 2010, and we have the increase amounts for both years (assuming these relate to reinsurance), the percentage change can be calculated as:\\[\n\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\text{Increase in 2010} - \\text{Increase in 2009}}{\\text{Increase in 2009}} \\times 100\n= \\frac{169 - 138}{138} \\times 100\n= \\frac{31}{138} \\times 100\n\\approx 22.46\\%\n\\]**Answer:**The net asbestos reserve increases related to reinsurance accounts increased by approximately **22.5%** from 2009 to 2010.","response_spans":[[0,224],[225,241],[242,604],[605,915],[916,1141],[1142,1345],[1346,1356],[1357,1478]],"labels":[{"start":1266,"end":1273,"confidence":0.6760754585,"text":" \\frac{"},{"start":1276,"end":1278,"confidence":0.5091625452,"text":" -"},{"start":1282,"end":1284,"confidence":0.5686110854,"text":"}{"},{"start":1287,"end":1329,"confidence":0.9364621639,"text":"} \\times 100\n= \\frac{31}{138} \\times 100\n\\"},{"start":1335,"end":1343,"confidence":0.7951222658,"text":" 22.46\\%"},{"start":1360,"end":1364,"confidence":0.5495889783,"text":" net"},{"start":1373,"end":1391,"confidence":0.5314338803,"text":" reserve increases"},{"start":1402,"end":1408,"confidence":0.5199949145,"text":" reins"},{"start":1414,"end":1479,"confidence":0.8451122642,"text":" accounts increased by approximately **22.5%** from 2009 to 2010."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"No \n- The response assumes the increases in net asbestos reserves ($169 in 2010 and $138 in 2009) are directly related to reinsurance accounts, which is not explicitly stated in the context.
