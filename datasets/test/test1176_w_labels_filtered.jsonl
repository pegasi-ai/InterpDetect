Airlines from participating in the ets. Ultimately, the scope and application of ets or other emissions trading schemes to our operations, now or in the near future, remains uncertain. Similarly, within the u. S., there is an increasing trend toward regulating ghg emissions directly under the caa. In response to a 2012 ruling by the u. S. Court of appeals district of columbia circuit requiring the epa to make a final determination on whether aircraft ghg emissions cause or contribute to air pollution, which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, the epa announced in september 2014 that it is in the process of making a determination regarding aircraft ghg emissions and anticipates proposing an endangerment finding by may 2015. If the epa makes a positive endangerment finding, the epa is obligated under the caa to set ghg emission standards for aircraft. Several states are also considering or have adopted initiatives to regulate emissions of ghgs, primarily through the planned development of ghg emissions inventories and\/or regional ghg cap and trade programs. These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the u. S. At the federal and state levels, are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in the u.

At december 31, 2009, there were approximately 15. 3 million shares of common stock reserved for future grants under the 2006 plan. Stock options we use a lattice binomial option-pricing model to value our stock option grants. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, or to the employee 2019s retirement eligible date, if earlier. Expected volatility is based on the weighted average of the most recent one-year volatility and a historical rolling average volatility of our stock over the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on federal reserve rates in effect for bonds with maturity dates equal to the expected term of the option. We use historical data to estimate future option exercises, forfeitures and expected life of the options.

At december 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $ 250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the company 2019s adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective january 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at december 31, 2010, resulting in a $ 250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at december 31, 2010. Excluding the $ 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $ 765. 2 million in 2010 compared to $ 559. 7 million in 2009 and $ 627. 6 million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $ 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:At its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $ 440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. The following table sets forth the volume of map 2019s consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales ( thousands of barrels per day ) 2003 2002 2001.[[\"( thousands of barrels per day )\", \"2003\", \"2002\", \"2001\"], [\"gasoline\", \"776\", \"773\", \"748\"], [\"distillates\", \"365\", \"346\", \"345\"], [\"propane\", \"21\", \"22\", \"21\"], [\"feedstocks and special products\", \"97\", \"82\", \"71\"], [\"heavy fuel oil\", \"24\", \"20\", \"41\"], [\"asphalt\", \"74\", \"75\", \"78\"], [\"total\", \"1357\", \"1318\", \"1304\"], [\"matching buy\/sell volumes included in above\", \"64\", \"71\", \"45\"]]Map sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin.

During 2015, the company contributed $ 264 million to its u. S. And international pension plans and $ 3 million to its postretirement plans. During 2014, the company contributed $ 210 million to its u. S. And international pension plans and $ 5 million to its postretirement plans. In 2016, the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $ 100 million to $ 200 million of cash to its u. S. And international retirement plans. The company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u. S. Plans in 2016. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. Future pension and postretirement benefit payments the following table provides the estimated pension and postretirement benefit payments that are payable from the plans to participants.

The primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3m. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of u. S. Pension liabilities. Normally, 3m does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3m securities. The aggregate amount of 3m securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages. The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See note 13 for descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nQuestion:what was the ratio of the company contribution to the us qualified and non-qualified pension benefits for 2015 compared to 2014\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1881],[1882,2328],[2329,3980],[3981,3990],[3991,4117],[4118,4125]],"num_tokens":1002,"response":"To determine the ratio of the company contribution to the US qualified and non-qualified pension benefits for 2015 compared to 2014, we need to look at the amounts contributed to these plans in each year.

Receivables securitization facility 2013 as of december 31, 2018, and 2017, we recorded $ 400 million and $ 500 million, respectively, of borrowings under our receivables facility, as secured debt. ( see further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in note 11 ). 16. Variable interest entities we have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities ( vies ). These vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions ( principally involving railroad equipment and facilities ) and have no other activities, assets or liabilities outside of the lease transactions. Within these lease arrangements, we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices. Depending on market conditions, fixed-price purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us; however, these benefits are not expected to be significant. We maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry. As such, we have no control over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets. We do not hold the power to direct the activities of the vies and, therefore, do not control the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the vies. Additionally, we do not have the obligation to absorb losses of the vies or the right to receive benefits of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies. We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our actions and decisions do not have the most significant effect on the vie 2019s performance and our fixed-price purchase options are not considered to be potentially significant to the vies. The future minimum lease payments associated with the vie leases totaled $ 1. 7 billion as of december 31, 2018. 17. Leases we lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property. The consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2018, and 2017 included $ 1454 million, net of $ 912 million of accumulated depreciation, and $ 1635 million, net of $ 953 million of accumulated depreciation, respectively, for properties held under capital leases. A charge to income resulting from the depreciation for assets held under capital leases is included within depreciation expense in our consolidated statements of income. Future minimum lease payments for operating and capital leases with initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december 31, 2018, were as follows: millions operating leases capital leases.[[\"millions\", \"operatingleases\", \"capitalleases\"], [\"2019\", \"$ 419\", \"$ 148\"], [\"2020\", \"378\", \"155\"], [\"2021\", \"303\", \"159\"], [\"2022\", \"272\", \"142\"], [\"2023\", \"234\", \"94\"], [\"later years\", \"1040\", \"200\"], [\"total minimum lease payments\", \"$ 2646\", \"$ 898\"], [\"amount representing interest\", \"n\/a\", \"-144 ( 144 )\"], [\"present value of minimum lease payments\", \"n\/a\", \"$ 754\"]]Approximately 97% ( 97 % ) of capital lease payments relate to locomotives.

Federal income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( 201creit 201d ) under the internal revenue code. To qualify as a reit, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% ( 90 % ) of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain our reit status. As a reit, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we distribute an amount equal to or in excess of our taxable income currently to shareholders. We are also generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to its shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years.\nQuestion:what is the net income per common share for the year 2007?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1859],[1860,2528],[2529,4154],[4155,4164],[4165,4222],[4223,4230]],"num_tokens":984,"response":"To find the net income per common share for the year 2007, we need to refer to the information provided in the context.

The increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $ 5 2022 billion is driven by a $ 6. 2 billion increase from net transfers in as the continued credit crisis impacted the availability of observable inputs for the underlying securities related to this liability. This was offset by a reduction from net settlements of $ 1. 4 billion.

Junior subordinated debt issued in connection with trust preferred securities. Group inc. Issued $ 2. 84 billion of junior subordinated debt in 2004 to goldman sachs capital i ( trust ), a delaware statutory trust. The trust issued $ 2. 75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests ( trust preferred securities ) to third parties and $ 85 million of common beneficial interests to group inc. And used the proceeds from the issuances to purchase the junior subordinated debt from group inc. During the second quarter of 2014, the firm purchased $ 1. 22 billion ( par amount ) of trust preferred securities and delivered these securities, along with $ 37. 6 million of common beneficial interests, to the trust in the third quarter of 2014 in exchange for a corresponding par amount of the junior subordinated debt.

The firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6. 345% ( 6. 345 % ) and the debt matures on february 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the trust 2019s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock.

Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs. Inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin 2019s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not been significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the taiwan dollar and british pound have proven to be relatively stable. However, periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the u. S. Dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The currencies that create a majority of the company 2019s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar and british pound. Garmin corporation, located in shijr, taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.

In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary 2019s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in u. S. Dollars. The td\/usd exchange rate decreased 0. 7% ( 0. 7 % ) during 2006, which resulted in a cumulative translation adjustment of negative $ 1. 2 million at the end of fiscal 2006 and a net foreign currency loss of $ 3. 1 million at garmin corporation during 2006.\nQuestion:considering the payments due to less than a year , what is the percentage of purchase obligations concerning the total expenses?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,298],[299,729],[730,3581],[3582,3591],[3592,3719],[3720,3727]],"num_tokens":817,"response":"To find the percentage of purchase obligations concerning the total expenses, we need to calculate the percentage of the total expenses that fall under purchase obligations.From the context, the total expenses are $296,554.

At december 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $ 250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the company 2019s adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective january 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at december 31, 2010, resulting in a $ 250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at december 31, 2010. Excluding the $ 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $ 765. 2 million in 2010 compared to $ 559. 7 million in 2009 and $ 627. 6 million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $ 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement. Management performance measures the following financial measurements are on a non-u. S. Gaap basis and should be considered in connection with the consolidated financial statements within item 8 of this report. Non-u. S. Gaap measures should not be considered in isolation and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with u. S. Gaap.

We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 400 million to $ 450 million over the four-year period ending december 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $ 289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $ 156 million in 2010 and $ 133 million in 2011.

Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above-described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1400 employees, or approximately 5% ( 5 % ) of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of december 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $ 86 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run-rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $ 400 million to $ 450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre-tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $ 575 million to $ 625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 160 million in 2015.

To verify, we need to calculate the percentage of $156 million out of the total $289 million recorded by the end of 2011.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the percentage\nTo find the percentage, we use the formula: (part\/whole) * 100 = ($156 million \/ $289 million) * 100.\n\n## Step 6: Perform the calculation\n($156 million \/ $289 million) * 100 = 0.5398 * 100 ≈ 54%.\n\n## Step 7: Compare the calculated percentage with the response\nThe response claims the percentage is 100%, but the calculation shows it's approximately 54%.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the faithfulness of the response\nSince the calculated percentage (54%) does not match the response (100%), the response is not faithful to the context.\n\n## Step 9: Output the result\nThe response is not supported by the context because it incorrectly states the percentage of aggregate restructuring charges recorded in 2010 as 100% instead of the correct 54%.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$ \nUnsupported parts: \n- The percent of the aggregate restructuring charges recorded in2010 is stated as 100%, which is incorrect. The correct percentage is approximately 54%.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No – the response incorrectly states that the 2010 restructuring charges represent 100 % of the aggregate (and treats the $156 million as a percent), which is unsupported. The context shows $156 million in 2010 out of a total $289 million, i.e., roughly 54 % of the aggregate charges.","labels_llama":1,"labels_gpt":1}

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Rm&t segment marathon 2019s rm&t operations primarily use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. Derivative instruments are used to mitigate the price risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. In addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 60% ( 60 % ) of the anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use through the first quarter of 2004 and 50% ( 50 % ) through the second quarter of 2004. Derivative commodity instruments are also used to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and lpg inventories. Derivatives are used to lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers. Derivative commodity instruments are used to protect against decreases in the future crack spreads. Within a limited framework, derivative instruments are also used to take advantage of opportunities identified in the commodity markets. Derivative gains ( losses ) included in rm&t segment income for each of the last two years are summarized in the following table: strategy ( in millions ) 2003 2002.[[\"strategy ( in millions )\", \"2003\", \"2002\"], [\"mitigate price risk\", \"$ -112 ( 112 )\", \"$ -95 ( 95 )\"], [\"protect carrying values of excess inventories\", \"-57 ( 57 )\", \"-41 ( 41 )\"], [\"protect margin on fixed price sales\", \"5\", \"11\"], [\"protect crack spread values\", \"6\", \"1\"], [\"trading activities\", \"-4 ( 4 )\", \"2013\"], [\"total net derivative losses\", \"$ -162 ( 162 )\", \"$ -124 ( 124 )\"]]Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Oerb segment marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. The underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. Similarly, marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term ( typically less than a year ) fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. Derivative gains ( losses ) included in oerb segment income were $ 19 million, $ ( 8 ) million and $ ( 29 ) million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. Oerb 2019s trading activity gains ( losses ) of $ ( 7 ) million, $ 4 million and $ ( 1 ) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are included in the aforementioned amounts. Other commodity risk marathon is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. For example, new york mercantile exchange ( 201cnymex 201d ) contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana 2019s henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. To the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. These regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. Otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. Marathon is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position.

The context states that securities with a carrying value of $4.7 billion were transferred from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale.\n2. The unrealized pre-tax gain on these securities was $7 million.\n\nThe response calculates the ratio of the pre-tax gain to the amount transferred as $\\frac{7}{4.7} = 1.49$. \n\nTo be faithful, the response must accurately reflect the information given in the context. The context indeed mentions the $4.7 billion carrying value and the $7 million pre-tax gain. Thus, the calculation appears to be supported.\n\nHowever, the response expresses the ratio as \"$1.49 million per $1 billion\". To verify this, we can normalize the ratio: $\\frac{7}{4.7} \\approx 1.49$. To express this per billion, we multiply by 1 billion: $1.49 \\times \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\frac{1000000}{1000000} = 1.49$ per $1 billion in terms of ratio, not dollars directly, so it should be understood as a ratio, not \"$1.49 million\". The actual expression should simply be the ratio or a properly scaled version.\n\nBut considering the essence of the response, it is attempting to provide a ratio that represents the gain relative to the amount transferred. The actual value is approximately 1.49 per thousand (since $7 million\/$4.7 billion = 0.00149 or 1.49 per thousand).\n\nTherefore, while the context supports the numbers used in the response, the expression \"$1.49 million per $1 billion\" misrepresents the actual ratio. The correct interpretation of $\\frac{7}{4.7}$ is approximately 1.49 per thousand.\n\nThe final answer is: **No** \n- The expression \"$1.49 million per $1 billion\" is not a correct representation of the ratio.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No — unsupported parts: \n- Incorrectly states the direction of the transfer (says “$4.7 billion in available‑for‑sale securities to held‑to‑maturity” instead of “held‑to‑maturity to available‑for‑sale”). \n- Misrepresents the ratio calculation (does not account for millions vs. billions and presents an incorrect “$1.49 million per $1 billion” figure). \n- Provides an inaccurate interpretation of the ratio (mixes units and gives an unsupported monetary conversion).","labels_llama":1,"labels_gpt":1}

The allocation of the purchase consideration is in the table below.

Due to the material ongoing modifications of the business, management has determined that insufficient information exists to accurately develop meaningful historical pro forma financial information. Moreover, the historical operations of blockbuster materially changed during the periods preceding the acquisition as a result of blockbuster inc. 2019s bankruptcy proceedings, and any historical pro forma information would not prove useful in assessing our post acquisition earnings and cash flows. The cost of goods sold on a unit basis for blockbuster in the current period was lower-than-historical costs. The carrying values in the current period of the rental library and merchandise inventories ( 201cblockbuster inventory 201d ) were reduced to their estimated fair value due to the application of purchase accounting. This impact on cost of goods sold on a unit basis will diminish in the future as we purchase new blockbuster inventory. 10. Spectrum investments terrestar transaction gamma acquisition l. L. C. ( 201cgamma 201d ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of dish network, entered into the terrestar transaction on june 14, 2011. On july 7, 2011, the u. S. Bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approved the asset purchase agreement with terrestar and we subsequently paid $ 1. 345 billion of the cash purchase price. Dish network is a party to the asset purchase agreement solely with respect to certain guaranty obligations. We have paid all but $ 30 million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction, which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction, or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011. We expect that the terrestar transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using purchase price accounting. We also expect to allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and\/or cost approach. We expect the purchase price of the terrestar assets to be allocated to, among other things, spectrum and satellites.\nQuestion:for the terrestar acquisition what will the final cash purchase price be in millions paid upon closing?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,423],[424,723],[724,3841],[3842,3851],[3852,3954],[3955,3962]],"num_tokens":833,"response":"The final cash purchase price for the terrestar acquisition is $1.345 billion, which is equal to $1,345,000 in millions.

Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effects for the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units based on the treasury stock method. The computation of diluted earnings per common share excluded 8. 0 million, 13. 4 million, and 14. 7 million stock options for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, primarily due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of our common stock during each respective reporting period. Note 3 2013 information on business segments we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Effective december 31, 2012, we operate in five business segments: aeronautics, information systems & global solutions ( is&gs ), missiles and fire control ( mfc ), mission systems and training ( mst ), and space systems. This structure reflects the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment into the new mfc and mst business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment. In connection with this reorganization, management layers at our former electronic systems business segment and our former global training and logistics ( gtl ) business were eliminated, and the former gtl business was split between the two new business segments. In addition, operating results for sandia corporation, which manages the sandia national laboratories for the u. S. Department of energy, and our equity interest in the u. K. Atomic weapons establishment joint venture were transferred from our former electronic systems business segment to our space systems business segment. The amounts, discussion, and presentation of our business segments reflect this reorganization for all years presented in this annual report on form 10-k. The following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments: 2030 aeronautics 2013 engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. 2030 information systems & global solutions 2013 provides management services, integrated information technology solutions, and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. 2030 missiles and fire control 2013 provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; logistics and other technical services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. 2030 mission systems and training 2013 provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; unmanned technologies and platforms; ship systems integration; and military and commercial training systems. 2030 space systems 2013 engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems.

S. Dispensing business within the medication management solutions ( 201cmms 201d ) unit of the medical segment, the company amended the terms of certain customer leases for dispensing equipment within the mms unit. The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 840, \"leases\", as the non- cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% ( 75 % ) of the equipment 2019s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% ( 90 % ) of the equipment 2019s fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term. Accordingly, most amended lease contracts were classified as operating leases beginning in april 2017. The change in lease classification resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in fiscal year 2017 of $ 748 million, which was recorded in other operating expense, net. Beginning april 1, 2017, revenue associated with these modified contracts has been recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with depreciation on the reinstated leased assets. The company's consolidated financial results in 2018 and 2017 were not materially impacted by the financing receivables remaining subsequent to the lease modification discussed above.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Rm&t segment marathon 2019s rm&t operations primarily use derivative commodity instruments to mitigate the price risk of certain crude oil and other feedstock purchases, to protect carrying values of excess inventories, to protect margins on fixed price sales of refined products and to lock-in the price spread between refined products and crude oil. Derivative instruments are used to mitigate the price risk between the time foreign and domestic crude oil and other feedstock purchases for refinery supply are priced and when they are actually refined into salable petroleum products. In addition, natural gas options are in place to manage the price risk associated with approximately 60% ( 60 % ) of the anticipated natural gas purchases for refinery use through the first quarter of 2004 and 50% ( 50 % ) through the second quarter of 2004. Derivative commodity instruments are also used to protect the value of excess refined product, crude oil and lpg inventories. Derivatives are used to lock in margins associated with future fixed price sales of refined products to non-retail customers. Derivative commodity instruments are used to protect against decreases in the future crack spreads. Within a limited framework, derivative instruments are also used to take advantage of opportunities identified in the commodity markets. Derivative gains ( losses ) included in rm&t segment income for each of the last two years are summarized in the following table: strategy ( in millions ) 2003 2002.[[\"strategy ( in millions )\", \"2003\", \"2002\"], [\"mitigate price risk\", \"$ -112 ( 112 )\", \"$ -95 ( 95 )\"], [\"protect carrying values of excess inventories\", \"-57 ( 57 )\", \"-41 ( 41 )\"], [\"protect margin on fixed price sales\", \"5\", \"11\"], [\"protect crack spread values\", \"6\", \"1\"], [\"trading activities\", \"-4 ( 4 )\", \"2013\"], [\"total net derivative losses\", \"$ -162 ( 162 )\", \"$ -124 ( 124 )\"]]Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Oerb segment marathon has used derivative instruments to convert the fixed price of a long-term gas sales contract to market prices. The underlying physical contract is for a specified annual quantity of gas and matures in 2008. Similarly, marathon will use derivative instruments to convert shorter term ( typically less than a year ) fixed price contracts to market prices in its ongoing purchase for resale activity; and to hedge purchased gas injected into storage for subsequent resale. Derivative gains ( losses ) included in oerb segment income were $ 19 million, $ ( 8 ) million and $ ( 29 ) million for 2003, 2002 and 2001. Oerb 2019s trading activity gains ( losses ) of $ ( 7 ) million, $ 4 million and $ ( 1 ) million in 2003, 2002 and 2001 are included in the aforementioned amounts. Other commodity risk marathon is subject to basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. For example, new york mercantile exchange ( 201cnymex 201d ) contracts for natural gas are priced at louisiana 2019s henry hub, while the underlying quantities of natural gas may be produced and sold in the western united states at prices that do not move in strict correlation with nymex prices. To the extent that commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased exposure to basis risk. These regional price differences could yield favorable or unfavorable results. Otc transactions are being used to manage exposure to a portion of basis risk. Marathon is subject to liquidity risk, caused by timing delays in liquidating contract positions due to a potential inability to identify a counterparty willing to accept an offsetting position. Due to the large number of active participants, liquidity risk exposure is relatively low for exchange-traded transactions.\nQuestion:for 2002 and 2003 , what is the average crack spread values?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1645],[1646,2037],[2038,4477],[4478,4487],[4488,4547],[4548,4555]],"num_tokens":994,"response":"To determine the average crack spread values for 2002 and 2003, we need to look at the information provided about the crack spread values in the context.

The new standard is effective for cadence in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. A modified retrospective approach is required, applying the new standard to leases existing as of the date of initial application. An entity may choose to apply the standard as of either its effective date or the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Cadence adopted the new standard on december 30, 2018, the first day of fiscal 2019, and used the effective date as the date of initial application. Consequently, financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Cadence elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed cadence to carry forward its prior conclusions about lease identification and classification.\nQuestion:what is the percentage change in the balance of retained earnings during 2018 after adjustments?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1646],[1647,2275],[2276,3723],[3724,3733],[3734,3829],[3830,3837]],"num_tokens":863,"response":"The cumulative effect adjustment for the adoption of the new accounting standard in 2018 is $8.3 million, which decreases retained earnings by that amount.

However, the question specifically asks for the percentage change in the balance of retained earnings during 2018 after adjustments. Since the balance after adjustments is negative, the percentage change is not a standard percentage but rather a negative value.

The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile of citigroup 2019s consolidated long-term debt, leases and other long-term liabilities. Citigroup 2019s contractual obligations include purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for citi. For the purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table ( unless citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement ). Other liabilities reflected on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, uncertain tax positions, as well as other long-term liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash. Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally short-term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain insurance and investment contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the consolidated balance sheet as insurance policy and claims reserves, contractholder funds, and separate and variable accounts. Citigroup 2019s funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At december 31, 2009, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned for the u. S. Pension plans.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:With respect to our business operations, we are standardizing certain core business processes, primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology, and driving automation of these business processes. We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 400 million to $ 450 million over the four-year period ending december 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $ 289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $ 156 million in 2010 and $ 133 million in 2011. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: ( in millions ) employee-related real estate consolidation information technology costs total.[[\"( in millions )\", \"employee-related costs\", \"real estate consolidation\", \"information technology costs\", \"total\"], [\"2010\", \"$ 105\", \"$ 51\", \"\", \"$ 156\"], [\"2011\", \"85\", \"7\", \"$ 41\", \"133\"], [\"total\", \"$ 190\", \"$ 58\", \"$ 41\", \"$ 289\"]]The employee-related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services. Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above-described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1400 employees, or approximately 5% ( 5 % ) of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of december 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $ 86 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run-rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $ 400 million to $ 450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre-tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $ 575 million to $ 625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 160 million in 2015. These annual pre-tax run-rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program.

Although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non-strategic properties, potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties. Transactions with unconsolidated entities transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity. From time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated entities, while retaining a continuing interest in that entity, and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own.

Pursuant to this strategy, we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook, including general economic conditions, supply and long-term growth potential. Our ability to make future property investments, along with being dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities, is also dependent upon our continued access to our longer-term sources of liquidity, including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties. Leasing\/capital costs tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to the initial leasing of newly completed or vacant space in acquired properties are referred to as first generation expenditures. Such expenditures are included within development of real estate investments and other deferred leasing costs in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Tenant improvements and leasing costs to re-let rental space that had been previously under lease to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures. Building improvements that are not specific to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures. One of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing\/capital expenditures of our real estate investments. As illustrated in the tables below, we have significantly reduced such expenditures in 2012 as a direct result of repositioning our investment concentration in office properties in accordance with our asset strategy.

Since the total minimum lease payments for 2015 is $759,700, and the total for the period up to 2015 is $777,443, the percentage is calculated as:$$\n\\frac{759,700}{777,443} \\times 100 \\approx 98.99\\%\n$$Thus, the percentage of total minimum lease payments due in 2015 is approximately **99%**.","response_spans":[[0,164],[165,263],[264,347],[348,402],[403,630],[631,686],[687,776]],"labels":[{"start":631,"end":633,"confidence":0.5007519126,"text":"$$"},{"start":634,"end":684,"confidence":0.8096270561,"text":"\\frac{759,700}{777,443} \\times 100 \\approx 98.99\\%"},{"start":692,"end":777,"confidence":0.7654358745,"text":" the percentage of total minimum lease payments due in 2015 is approximately **99%**."}],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"No\n- The response incorrectly calculates the percentage of total minimum lease payments due in 2015.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:With respect to our business operations, we are standardizing certain core business processes, primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology, and driving automation of these business processes. We are currently creating a new technology platform, including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud, and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support. We expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in 2013 and 2014. To implement this program, we expect to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 400 million to $ 450 million over the four-year period ending december 31, 2014. To date, we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $ 289 million in our consolidated statement of income, composed of $ 156 million in 2010 and $ 133 million in 2011. The following table presents the charges by type of cost: ( in millions ) employee-related real estate consolidation information technology costs total.[[\"( in millions )\", \"employee-related costs\", \"real estate consolidation\", \"information technology costs\", \"total\"], [\"2010\", \"$ 105\", \"$ 51\", \"\", \"$ 156\"], [\"2011\", \"85\", \"7\", \"$ 41\", \"133\"], [\"total\", \"$ 190\", \"$ 58\", \"$ 41\", \"$ 289\"]]The employee-related costs included costs related to severance, benefits and outplacement services. Real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties. Information technology costs included transition fees related to the above-described expansion of our use of service providers. In 2010, in connection with the program, we initiated the involuntary termination of 1400 employees, or approximately 5% ( 5 % ) of our global workforce, which was substantially complete at the end of 2011. In addition, in the third quarter of 2011, in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support, we identified 530 employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated. As of december 31, 2011, in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of 1930 employees described above, 1332 employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street, including 782 employees in 2011. In connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program, we achieved approximately $ 86 million of annual pre-tax, run-rate expense savings in 2011 compared to 2010 run-rate expenses. Excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of $ 400 million to $ 450 million described earlier, we expect the program to reduce our pre-tax expenses from operations, on an annualized basis, by approximately $ 575 million to $ 625 million by the end of 2014 compared to 2010, with the full effect realized in 2015. Assuming all other things equal, we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 540 million by the end of 2014, for a total annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 600 million to be realized in 2015. We expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 440 million in 2015, with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of 2013. In addition, we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre-tax expense savings of approximately $ 160 million in 2015. These annual pre-tax run-rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program. Our actual operating expenses may increase or decrease as a result of other factors. The majority of the annualized savings will affect compensation and employee benefits expenses; these savings will be modestly offset by increases in information systems and communications expenses as we implement the program. 2011 expense control measures during the fourth quarter of 2011, in connection with expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets-facing businesses in 2012, we took two actions.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:System energy resources, inc. Management's financial discussion and analysis operating activities cash flow from operations increased by $ 232. 1 million in 2004 primarily due to income tax refunds of $ 70. 6 million in 2004 compared to income tax payments of $ 230. 9 million in 2003. The increase was partially offset by money pool activity, as discussed below. In 2003, the domestic utility companies and system energy filed, with the irs, a change in tax accounting method notification for their respective calculations of cost of goods sold. The adjustment implemented a simplified method of allocation of overhead to the production of electricity, which is provided under the irs capitalization regulations. The cumulative adjustment placing these companies on the new methodology resulted in a $ 430 million deduction for system energy on entergy's 2003 income tax return. There was no cash benefit from the method change in 2003. In 2004 system energy realized $ 144 million in cash tax benefit from the method change. This tax accounting method change is an issue across the utility industry and will likely be challenged by the irs on audit. Cash flow from operations decreased by $ 124. 8 million in 2003 primarily due to the following: 2022 an increase in federal income taxes paid of $ 74. 0 million in 2003 compared to 2002; 2022 the cessation of the entergy mississippi ggart. System energy collected $ 21. 7 million in 2003 and $ 40. 8 million in 2002 from entergy mississippi in conjunction with the ggart, which provided for the acceleration of entergy mississippi's grand gulf purchased power obligation. The mpsc authorized cessation of the ggart effective july 1, 2003. See note 2 to the domestic utility companies and system energy financial statements for further discussion of the ggart; and 2022 money pool activity, as discussed below. System energy's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of december 31 for each of the following years:.[[\"2004\", \"2003\", \"2002\", \"2001\"], [\"( in thousands )\", \"( in thousands )\", \"( in thousands )\", \"( in thousands )\"], [\"$ 61592\", \"$ 19064\", \"$ 7046\", \"$ 13853\"]]Money pool activity used $ 42. 5 million of system energy's operating cash flows in 2004, used $ 12. 0 million in 2003, and provided $ 6. 8 million in 2002. See note 4 to the domestic utility companies and system energy financial statements for a description of the money pool. Investing activities net cash used for investing activities was practically unchanged in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily because an increase in construction expenditures caused by a reclassification of inventory items to capital was significantly offset by the maturity of $ 6. 5 million of other temporary investments that had been made in 2003, which provided cash in 2004. The increase of $ 16. 2 million in net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was primarily due to the following: 2022 the maturity in 2002 of $ 22. 4 million of other temporary investments that had been made in 2001, which provided cash in 2002; 2022 an increase in decommissioning trust contributions and realized change in trust assets of $ 8. 2 million in 2003 compared to 2002; and 2022 other temporary investments of $ 6. 5 million made in 2003.

S. Dispensing business within the medication management solutions ( 201cmms 201d ) unit of the medical segment, the company amended the terms of certain customer leases for dispensing equipment within the mms unit. The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 840, \"leases\", as the non- cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% ( 75 % ) of the equipment 2019s estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% ( 90 % ) of the equipment 2019s fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term. Accordingly, most amended lease contracts were classified as operating leases beginning in april 2017. The change in lease classification resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in fiscal year 2017 of $ 748 million, which was recorded in other operating expense, net.

The table includes information about payments due under specified contractual obligations, aggregated by type of contractual obligation. It includes the maturity profile of citigroup 2019s consolidated long-term debt, leases and other long-term liabilities. Citigroup 2019s contractual obligations include purchase obligations that are enforceable and legally binding for citi. For the purposes of the table below, purchase obligations are included through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. Many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citigroup to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in the table ( unless citigroup has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement ). Other liabilities reflected on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet include obligations for goods and services that have already been received, uncertain tax positions, as well as other long-term liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash. Excluded from the following table are obligations that are generally short-term in nature, including deposit liabilities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The table also excludes certain insurance and investment contracts subject to mortality and morbidity risks or without defined maturities, such that the timing of payments and withdrawals is uncertain. The liabilities related to these insurance and investment contracts are included on the consolidated balance sheet as insurance policy and claims reserves, contractholder funds, and separate and variable accounts. Citigroup 2019s funding policy for pension plans is generally to fund to the minimum amounts required by the applicable laws and regulations. At december 31, 2009, there were no minimum required contributions, and no contributions are currently planned for the u. S. Pension plans. Accordingly, no amounts have been included in the table below for future contributions to the u. S. Pension plans. For the non-u. S. Pension plans, discretionary contributions in 2010 are anticipated to be approximately $ 160 million. The anticipated cash contributions in 2010 related to the non-u. S. Postretirement benefit plans are $ 72 million. These amounts are included in the purchase obligations in the table below. The estimated pension and postretirement plan contributions are subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors, such as market performance, regulatory and legal requirements, and management 2019s ability to change funding policy.

The company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:.[[\"land improvements\", \"20\"], [\"buildings\", \"39-40\"], [\"furniture fixtures and equipment\", \"3-10\"]]Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. In accordance with sfas 144, 201caccounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, 201d the company reviews for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease. The company 2019s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset 2019s fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon future cash flows ( discounted at the company 2019s credit adjusted risk-free rate ) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value. The company recorded impairment charges included in sg&a expense of approximately $ 0. 2 million in the 2007 predecessor period, $ 9. 4 million in 2006 and $ 0. 6 million in 2005 to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores 2019 assets as deemed necessary due to negative sales trends and cash flows at these locations. The majority of the 2006 charges were recorded pursuant to certain strategic initiatives discussed in note 3. Goodwill and other intangible assets the company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows, and, if impaired, written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment and written down to fair value as required.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:At its catlettsburg, kentucky refinery, map has completed the approximately $ 440 million multi-year integrated investment program to upgrade product yield realizations and reduce fixed and variable manufacturing expenses. This program involves the expansion, conversion and retirement of certain refinery processing units that, in addition to improving profitability, will allow the refinery to begin producing low-sulfur ( tier 2 ) gasoline. Project startup was in the first quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2003, map commenced approximately $ 300 million in new capital projects for its 74000 bpd detroit, michigan refinery. One of the projects, a $ 110 million expansion project, is expected to raise the crude oil capacity at the refinery by 35 percent to 100000 bpd. Other projects are expected to enable the refinery to produce new clean fuels and further control regulated air emissions. Completion of the projects is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2005. Marathon will loan map the funds necessary for these upgrade and expansion projects. Marketing in 2003, map 2019s refined product sales volumes ( excluding matching buy\/sell transactions ) totaled 19. 8 billion gallons ( 1293000 bpd ). Excluding sales related to matching buy\/sell transactions, the wholesale distribution of petroleum products to private brand marketers and to large commercial and industrial consumers, primarily located in the midwest, the upper great plains and the southeast, and sales in the spot market, accounted for approximately 70 percent of map 2019s refined product sales volumes in 2003. Approximately 50 percent of map 2019s gasoline volumes and 91 percent of its distillate volumes were sold on a wholesale or spot market basis to independent unbranded customers or other wholesalers in 2003. Approximately half of map 2019s propane is sold into the home heating markets and industrial consumers purchase the balance. Propylene, cumene, aromatics, aliphatics, and sulfur are marketed to customers in the chemical industry. Base lube oils and slack wax are sold throughout the united states. Pitch is also sold domestically, but approximately 13 percent of pitch products are exported into growing markets in canada, mexico, india, and south america. Map markets asphalt through owned and leased terminals throughout the midwest and southeast. The map customer base includes approximately 900 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities ( states, counties, cities and townships ) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. The following table sets forth the volume of map 2019s consolidated refined product sales by product group for each of the last three years: refined product sales ( thousands of barrels per day ) 2003 2002 2001.[[\"( thousands of barrels per day )\", \"2003\", \"2002\", \"2001\"], [\"gasoline\", \"776\", \"773\", \"748\"], [\"distillates\", \"365\", \"346\", \"345\"], [\"propane\", \"21\", \"22\", \"21\"], [\"feedstocks and special products\", \"97\", \"82\", \"71\"], [\"heavy fuel oil\", \"24\", \"20\", \"41\"], [\"asphalt\", \"74\", \"75\", \"78\"], [\"total\", \"1357\", \"1318\", \"1304\"], [\"matching buy\/sell volumes included in above\", \"64\", \"71\", \"45\"]]Map sells reformulated gasoline in parts of its marketing territory, primarily chicago, illinois; louisville, kentucky; northern kentucky; and milwaukee, wisconsin.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:American tower corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 19. Commitments and contingencies litigation 2014the company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the company 2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Tristar litigation 2014the company was involved in several lawsuits against tristar investors llp and its affiliates ( 201ctristar 201d ) in various states regarding single tower sites where tristar had taken land interests under the company 2019s owned or managed sites and the company believes tristar induced the landowner to breach obligations to the company. In addition, on february 16, 2012, tristar brought a federal action against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of texas ( the 201cdistrict court 201d ), in which tristar principally alleged that the company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with tristar for land under the company 2019s owned or managed sites. On january 22, 2013, the company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against tristar and certain of its employees, denying tristar 2019s claims and asserting that tristar engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: ( i ) entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and ( ii ) making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both tristar and the company. Pursuant to a settlement agreement dated july 9, 2014, all pending state and federal actions between the company and tristar were dismissed with prejudice and without payment of damages. Lease obligations 2014the company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to cpi or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the company 2019s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the company will renew the leases.

For additional information regarding stock options awarded in 2008 to each of the named executive officers, see the 2008 grants of plan-based awards table. Under the equity ownership plans, all options must have an exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of entergy corporation common stock on the date of grant. In 2008, entergy corporation implemented guidelines that require an executive officer to achieve and maintain a level of entergy corporation stock ownership equal to a multiple of his or her salary. Until an executive officer achieves the multiple ownership position of entergy corporation common stock, the executive officer ( including a named executive officer ) upon exercising any stock option granted on or after january 1, 2003, must retain at least 75% ( 75 % ) of the after-tax net profit from such stock option exercise in the form of entergy corporation common stock. Entergy corporation has not adopted a formal policy regarding the granting of options at times when it is in possession of material non-public information. However, entergy corporation generally grants options to named executive officers only during the month of january in connection with its annual executive compensation decisions. On occasion, it may grant options to newly hired employees or existing employees for retention or other limited purposes. Restricted units restricted units granted under the equity ownership plans represent phantom shares of entergy corporation common stock ( i. E., non-stock interests that have an economic value equivalent to a share of entergy corporation common stock ). Entergy corporation occasionally grants restricted units for retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or other limited purposes. If all conditions of the grant are satisfied, restrictions on the restricted units lift at the end of the restricted period, and a cash equivalent value of the restricted units is paid. The settlement price is equal to the number of restricted units multiplied by the closing price of entergy corporation common stock on the date restrictions lift. Restricted units are not entitled to dividends or voting rights. Restricted units are generally time-based awards for which restrictions lift, subject to continued employment, over a two- to five-year period. In january 2008, the committee granted mr. Denault, entergy corporation's chief financial officer, 24000 restricted units. The committee determined that, in light of the numerous strategic challenges facing entergy ( including the challenges associated with the completion of entergy's pending separation of its non- utility nuclear business ) it was essential that entergy retain mr.

Denault's broader role in the leadership of entergy. In determining the size of the grant, the committee consulted its independent consultant to confirm that the grant was consistent with market practices. The committee chose restricted units over other retention instruments because it believes that restricted stock units better align the interest of the officer with entergy corporation's shareholders in terms of growing shareholder value and increasing shareholder returns on equity.

At december 31, 2009, the amount of accounts receivable sold under the securitization program was $ 250 million and, under the previous accounting guidance, this amount was presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of accounts receivable as a result of the true sale of receivables. However, upon the company 2019s adoption of new prospective accounting guidance effective january 1, 2010, the amount of accounts receivable sold is not reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the balance sheet at december 31, 2010, resulting in a $ 250 million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding working capital outflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flows. There were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program at december 31, 2010. Excluding the $ 250 million impact of additional accounts receivable from the change in accounting discussed above, cash flows provided by operations were $ 765. 2 million in 2010 compared to $ 559. 7 million in 2009 and $ 627. 6 million in 2008. The significant improvement in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings and favorable working capital changes, partially offset by higher pension funding. Lower operating cash flows in 2009 compared to 2008 were the result of working capital increases and higher pension funding and income tax payments during the year, offset by the payment of approximately $ 70 million to a customer for a legal settlement.

Net revenue 2016 compared to 2015 net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1 ) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2 ) purchased power expenses, and 3 ) other regulatory charges ( credits ). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2016 to 2015.

See note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion on the formula rate plan and the storm damage rider. The volume\/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 153 gwh, or 1% ( 1 % ), in billed electricity usage, including an increase in industrial usage, partially offset by the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales. The increase in industrial usage is primarily due to expansion projects in the pulp and paper industry, increased demand for existing customers, primarily in the metals industry, and new customers in the wood products industry.\nQuestion:what is the net change in net revenue during 20016 for entergy mississippi , inc.?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1444],[1445,1726],[1727,2572],[2573,2582],[2583,2664],[2665,2672]],"num_tokens":630,"response":"The net change in net revenue for Entergy Mississippi, Inc. during 2016 is $705.4 million.

Based on this evaluation, the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011. During 2011, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim frequency, severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims, particularly against certain smaller, more peripheral insureds. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders. During 2010 and 2009, for certain direct policyholders, the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense. Increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, development on primarily peripheral accounts. The company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders.

In addition, as part of the consideration, certain outstanding hewitt stock options were converted into options to purchase 4. 5 million shares of aon common stock. These items are detailed further in note 9 2018 2018debt 2019 2019 and note 12 2018 2018stockholders 2019 equity 2019 2019. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Certain estimated values are not yet finalized ( see below ) and are subject to change, which could be significant. The company will finalize the amounts recognized as information necessary to complete the analyses is obtained.

The acquired customer relationships are being amortized over a weighted average life of 12 years. The technology asset is being amortized over 7 years and trademarks have been determined to have indefinite useful lives.

Fluctuations in the value of these currencies against the us dollar, particularly the value of the euro, can have a direct and material impact on the business and financial results. For example, a decline in the value of the euro versus the us dollar results in a decline in the us dollar value of our sales and earnings denominated in euros due to translation effects. Likewise, an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar would result in an opposite effect. To protect the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation, we entered into cross currency swaps with certain financial institutions in 2004. The cross currency swaps and the euro-denominated portion of the senior term loan were designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. We dedesignated the net investment hedge due to the debt refinancing in april 2007 and redesignated the cross currency swaps and new senior euro term loan in july 2007. As a result, we recorded $ 26 million of mark-to-market losses related to the cross currency swaps and the new senior euro term loan during this period. Under the terms of the cross currency swap arrangements, we paid approximately a13 million in interest and received approximately $ 16 million in interest on june 15 and december 15 of each year. The fair value of the net obligation under the cross currency swaps was included in current other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31, 2007. Upon maturity of the cross currency swap arrangements in june 2008, we owed a276 million ( $ 426 million ) and were owed $ 333 million. In settlement of the obligation, we paid $ 93 million ( net of interest of $ 3 million ) in june 2008. During the year ended december 31, 2008, we dedesignated a385 million of the a400 million euro-denominated portion of the term loan, previously designated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation. The remaining a15 million euro-denominated portion of the term loan was dedesignated as a hedge of a net investment of a foreign operation in june 2009. Prior to these dedesignations, we had been using external derivative contracts to offset foreign currency exposures on certain intercompany loans. As a result of the dedesignations, the foreign currency exposure created by the euro-denominated term loan is expected to offset the foreign currency exposure on certain intercompany loans, decreasing the need for external derivative contracts and reducing our exposure to external counterparties. See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our foreign exchange risk management and the related impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program 2019s effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions.

The primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3m. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of u. S. Pension liabilities. Normally, 3m does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3m securities. The aggregate amount of 3m securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages. The discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See note 13 for descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nQuestion:in 2016 what was the ratio of the us to the international qualified and non-qualified pension benefits\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,1881],[1882,2328],[2329,3980],[3981,3990],[3991,4092],[4093,4100]],"num_tokens":994,"response":"The question asks for the ratio of the U.S. to the international qualified and non-qualified pension benefits in 2016.

Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other limitations. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock awards performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Vesting of the awards is dependent on devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. In order for awards to vest, the performance target must be met in the first year, and if met, recipients are entitled to dividends on the awards over the remaining service vesting period. If the performance target and service period requirements are not met, the award does not vest. Devon estimates the fair values of the awards as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing devon 2019s tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified two- or three- year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200% ( 200 % ) of the units granted depending on devon 2019s tsr as compared to the peer group on the vesting date. At the end of the vesting period, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: ( i ) a risk-free interest rate based on u. S. Treasury rates as of the grant date; ( ii ) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of devon and the designated peer group; and ( iii ) an estimated ranking of devon among the designated peer group.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. Credit default swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit indices, baskets and tranches. Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure. Total return swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. Credit options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Advance payments and billings in excess of revenues - payments received in excess of inventoried costs and revenues are recorded as advance payment liabilities. Property, plant, and equipment - depreciable properties owned by the company are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of individual assets. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are expensed. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, not to exceed nine years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease. The remaining assets are depreciated using the straight-line method, with the following lives:.[[\"land improvements\", \"years 3\", \"years -\", \"years 40\"], [\"buildings and improvements\", \"3\", \"-\", \"60\"], [\"capitalized software costs\", \"3\", \"-\", \"9\"], [\"machinery and other equipment\", \"2\", \"-\", \"45\"]]The company evaluates the recoverability of its property, plant, and equipment when there are changes in economic circumstances or business objectives that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The company's evaluations include estimated future cash flows, profitability, and other factors affecting fair value. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary to record impairment charges. Leases - the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification as capital or operating and defines the initial lease term to include renewal options determined to be reasonably assured. The company conducts operations primarily under operating leases. Many of the company's real property lease agreements contain incentives for tenant improvements, rent holidays, or rent escalation clauses. For incentives for tenant improvements, the company records a deferred rent liability and amortizes the deferred rent over the term of the lease as a reduction to rent expense. For rent holidays and rent escalation clauses during the lease term, the company records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. For purposes of recognizing lease incentives, the company uses the date of initial possession as the commencement date, which is generally the date on which the company is given the right of access to the space and begins to make improvements in preparation for the intended use. Goodwill and other intangible assets - the company performs impairment tests for goodwill as of november 30 of each year and between annual impairment tests if evidence of potential impairment exists, by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired, by comparing the estimated fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. Purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or a method based on the pattern of benefits over their estimated useful lives, and the carrying value of these assets is reviewed for impairment when events indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. Equity method investments - investments in which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee but does not own a majority interest or otherwise control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in other assets in its consolidated statements of financial position. The company's equity investments align strategically and are integrated with the company's operations, and therefore the company's share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating income ( loss ). The company evaluates its equity investments for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be fully recoverable. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Self-insured group medical insurance - the company maintains a self-insured group medical insurance plan. The plan is designed to provide a specified level of coverage for employees and their dependents.

This implies that the range for depreciating land improvements is between 3 years and 40 years.\n\nThe question asks for the minimum yearly depreciation rate that can be used for land improvements.\n\nThe response states that the minimum yearly depreciation rate for land improvements is **3 years**.\n\nTo assess if the response is faithful to the context, we need to understand that the \"minimum yearly depreciation rate\" refers to the shortest period over which land improvements can be depreciated. The context indicates that land improvements are depreciated over a range of 3 to 40 years. Therefore, the minimum period is indeed 3 years.\n\nThus, the response is accurate and supported by the context.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No – the response incorrectly treats “3 years” as a depreciation rate.

See notes 6 through 8 for further information about level 3 financial assets ( including information about unrealized gains and losses related to level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities, and transfers in and out of level 3 ). Note 6. Cash instruments cash instruments include u. S. Government and agency obligations, non-u. S. Government and agency obligations, mortgage-backed loans and securities, corporate loans and debt securities, equity securities, investments in funds at nav, and other non-derivative financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased. See below for the types of cash instruments included in each level of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine their fair values. See note 5 for an overview of the firm 2019s fair value measurement policies. Level 1 cash instruments level 1 cash instruments include certain money market instruments, u. S. Government obligations, most non-u. S. Government obligations, certain government agency obligations, certain corporate debt securities and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. Level 2 cash instruments level 2 cash instruments include most money market instruments, most government agency obligations, certain non-u. S. Government obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate loans and debt securities, most state and municipal obligations, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, commodities and certain lending commitments. Valuations of level 2 cash instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations ( e. G., indicative or firm ) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 cash instruments ( i ) if the cash instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and\/or ( ii ) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. Level 3 cash instruments level 3 cash instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 cash instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales of financial assets. Valuation techniques and significant inputs of level 3 cash instruments valuation techniques of level 3 cash instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 cash instrument are described below: loans and securities backed by commercial real estate. Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single commercial real estate property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination.

Approximately 57100 square feet of space is occupied by our lease administration office and our broadcast division, and we lease the remaining space to unaffiliated tenants. In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain 15 regional area offices in the united states through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. We have also established an office in delhi, india to pursue business opportunities in india and southeast asia, and we have an international business development group based in london, england. Our interests in our communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to the loan agreement for the securitization, the tower sites subject to the securitization are subject to mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. There are three principal types of towers: guyed, self- supporting lattice, and monopole. 2022 a guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground. A guyed tower can reach heights of up to 2000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres. 2022 a lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10000 square feet for a rural site or less than 2500 square feet for a metropolitan site. 2022 a monopole is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet. A monopole tower site of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of less than 2500 square feet.\nQuestion:what is the range of height of monopole towers , in feet?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,385],[386,1181],[1182,3581],[3582,3591],[3592,3648],[3649,3656]],"num_tokens":827,"response":"The range of height of monopole towers is from 50 to 200 feet.

Commitments and contingencies litigation 2014the company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the company 2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Tristar litigation 2014the company was involved in several lawsuits against tristar investors llp and its affiliates ( 201ctristar 201d ) in various states regarding single tower sites where tristar had taken land interests under the company 2019s owned or managed sites and the company believes tristar induced the landowner to breach obligations to the company. In addition, on february 16, 2012, tristar brought a federal action against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of texas ( the 201cdistrict court 201d ), in which tristar principally alleged that the company made misrepresentations to landowners when competing with tristar for land under the company 2019s owned or managed sites. On january 22, 2013, the company filed an amended answer and counterclaim against tristar and certain of its employees, denying tristar 2019s claims and asserting that tristar engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, including: ( i ) entering into agreements not to compete for land under certain towers; and ( ii ) making widespread misrepresentations to landowners regarding both tristar and the company. Pursuant to a settlement agreement dated july 9, 2014, all pending state and federal actions between the company and tristar were dismissed with prejudice and without payment of damages. Lease obligations 2014the company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to cpi or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases. Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the company 2019s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the company will renew the leases.

The response correctly states the individual values for consolidated subsidiaries and non-consolidated affiliates as per the context.\n\nHowever, the question implicitly seeks the total value. The total can be calculated by summing $540.8 million and $167.3 million, which equals $708.1 million. The response does not explicitly state this total.\n\nDespite this, the response is considered faithful because it directly quotes the values from the context.

These offices are located in ontario, california; marietta, georgia; crest hill, illinois; worcester, massachusetts; new hudson, michigan; mount pleasant, south carolina; and kent, washington. In addition, we maintain smaller field offices within each of the areas at locations as needed from time to time. Our interests in individual communications sites are comprised of a variety of fee and leasehold interests in land and\/or buildings ( rooftops ). Of the approximately 15000 towers comprising our portfolio, approximately 16% ( 16 % ) are located on parcels of land that we own and approximately 84% ( 84 % ) are either located on parcels of land that have leasehold interests created by long-term lease agreements, private easements and easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities, or are sites that we manage for third parties. In rural areas, a wireless communications site typically consists of a 10000 square foot tract, which supports towers, equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the structure, whereas a broadcast tower site typically consists of a tract of land of up to twenty-acres. Less than 2500 square feet are required for a monopole or self-supporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communication tower sites. Land leases generally have an initial term of five years with three or four additional automatic renewal periods of five years, for a total of twenty to twenty-five years. Pursuant to our credit facilities, our lenders have liens on, among other things, all towers, leasehold interests, tenant leases and contracts relating to the management of towers for others. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. Item 3.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Our previously announced stock repurchase program, and any subsequent stock purchase program put in place from time to time, could affect the price of our common stock, increase the volatility of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves. Such repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, the price of our common stock, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions. We may effect repurchases under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including accelerated stock repurchase arrangements. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program 2019s effectiveness. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions.

Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effects for the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units based on the treasury stock method. The computation of diluted earnings per common share excluded 8. 0 million, 13. 4 million, and 14. 7 million stock options for the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, primarily due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of our common stock during each respective reporting period. Note 3 2013 information on business segments we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. Effective december 31, 2012, we operate in five business segments: aeronautics, information systems & global solutions ( is&gs ), missiles and fire control ( mfc ), mission systems and training ( mst ), and space systems. This structure reflects the reorganization of our former electronic systems business segment into the new mfc and mst business segments in order to streamline our operations and enhance customer alignment. In connection with this reorganization, management layers at our former electronic systems business segment and our former global training and logistics ( gtl ) business were eliminated, and the former gtl business was split between the two new business segments. In addition, operating results for sandia corporation, which manages the sandia national laboratories for the u. S. Department of energy, and our equity interest in the u. K. Atomic weapons establishment joint venture were transferred from our former electronic systems business segment to our space systems business segment. The amounts, discussion, and presentation of our business segments reflect this reorganization for all years presented in this annual report on form 10-k. The following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments: 2030 aeronautics 2013 engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support, and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies. 2030 information systems & global solutions 2013 provides management services, integrated information technology solutions, and advanced technology systems and expertise across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. 2030 missiles and fire control 2013 provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support, and integration services; logistics and other technical services; and manned and unmanned ground vehicles. 2030 mission systems and training 2013 provides surface ship and submarine combat systems; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; littoral combat ships; simulation and training services; unmanned technologies and platforms; ship systems integration; and military and commercial training systems. 2030 space systems 2013 engaged in the research and development, design, engineering, and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems, and space transportation systems. Space systems is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Operating results for our space systems business segment include our equity interests in united launch alliance, which provides expendable launch services for the u. S.

It includes the number of options and the weighted-average exercise price for each year.\n\n## Step 3: Examine the response\nThe response calculates the total value of the balance of options as of December 31, 2002. It uses the number of shares (6,474,102) and the weighted-average exercise price ($9.10) to calculate the total value.\n\n## Step 4: Verify the calculation\nThe calculation provided in the response is: $6,474,102 × $9.10 = $58,914,328.2. The response states the result as $58,800,000, which is a rounded version of the actual calculation.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the faithfulness of the response to the context\nThe context provides the necessary information: the balance of options as of December 31, 2002, is 6,474,102 shares, and the weighted-average exercise price is $9.10. The response correctly uses this information to calculate the total value.\n\n## Step 6: Check for any unsupported parts\nThe response assumes that the total value of the options is the product of the number of shares and the weighted-average exercise price. This is a reasonable assumption for calculating the total value based on the exercise price, but it's worth noting that the actual value realized upon exercise could differ.\n\n## Step 7: Determine the accuracy of the response\nThe calculation $6,474,102 × $9.10 = $58,914,328.2 is mathematically correct. The response rounds this to $58,800,000, which is a minor approximation.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude on the faithfulness of the response\nThe response is faithful to the context as it directly uses the data provided and performs a straightforward calculation based on that data.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{Yes}$","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"No – the response contains unsupported or inaccurate statements:\n- It incorrectly says the “balance” for December 31 2002 is $9.10 (that is the weighted‑average exercise price, not the balance amount).\n- The calculated total value ($58,800,000) is inaccurate; 6,474,102 shares × $9.10 ≈ $58.9 million (≈ $58,914,328).","labels_llama":0,"labels_gpt":1}

During the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company recorded aggregate net unrealized ( losses ) gains of approximately $ ( 4. 8 ) million, $ 1. 9 million, and $ 9. 5 million, respectively ( net of tax benefits ( provisions ) of approximately $ 0. 7 million, $ ( 1. 3 ) million, and $ ( 6. 0 ) million, respectively ) in accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income for the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The company is amortizing the deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock as additional interest expense over the term of the 7. 00% ( 7. 00 % ) notes, and is amortizing the deferred gain on the settlement of interest rate swap agreements entered into in connection with the securitization as a reduction in interest expense over the five-year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges. For the year ended december 31, 2012, the company reclassified $ 0. 6 million into results of operations. The company reclassified an aggregate of $ 0. 1 million ( net of income tax provisions of $ 0. 1 million ) into results of operations during the years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result of the reit conversion described in note 1, effective december 31, 2011, the company reversed the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the entities operating its reit activities. Accordingly, approximately $ 1. 8 million of deferred tax assets associated with the deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock and the deferred gain on the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement entered into in connection with the securitization were reclassified to other comprehensive income. 12.

Basis of presentation and accounting policies ( continued ) vendor rebates the company accounts for all cash consideration received from vendors in accordance with applicable accounting standards pertaining to such arrangements. Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of merchandise purchase costs as earned. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying sg&a expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products may be offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs. The company recognizes amounts received for cooperative advertising on performance, 2018 2018first showing 2019 2019 or distribution, consistent with its policy for advertising expense in accordance with applicable accounting standards for reporting on advertising costs. Prepaid expenses and other current assets prepaid expenses and other current assets include prepaid amounts for rent, maintenance, advertising, and insurance, as well as amounts receivable for certain vendor rebates ( primarily those expected to be collected in cash ), coupons, and other items. Property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost. The company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:.[[\"land improvements\", \"20\"], [\"buildings\", \"39 - 40\"], [\"furniture fixtures and equipment\", \"3 - 10\"]]Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present, the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, other than goodwill, in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. In accordance with accounting standards for long-lived assets, the company reviews for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease. The company 2019s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset 2019s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future cash flows ( discounted at the company 2019s credit adjusted risk-free rate ) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. Credit default swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit indices, baskets and tranches. Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure. Total return swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. Credit options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

The company classifies deferred financing costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the long-term debt liability on the consolidated balance sheets, except for deferred financing costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements which are presented as an asset, included within 201cother assets 201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivatives the company has entered into interest rate cap agreements for the purpose of economically hedging its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The company 2019s interest rate cap agreements are not designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded directly to interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair value measurements fair value is defined under gaap as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs to prioritize the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: level 1 2013 observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 2013 inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 2013 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management 2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

As of december 31, 2015, we had non-cancelable purchase commitments of $ 43. 9 million to our contract manufacturers and suppliers. We have provided restricted deposits to our third-party contract manufacturers and vendors to secure our obligations to purchase inventory. We had $ 2. 3 million in restricted deposits as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014. Restricted deposits are classified in other assets in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Guarantees we have entered into agreements with some of our direct customers and channel partners that contain indemnification provisions relating to potential situations where claims could be alleged that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. We have at our option and expense the ability to repair any infringement, replace product with a non-infringing equivalent-in-function product or refund our customers.\nQuestion:as of december 31 , 2015 , are purchase commitments greater than expected 2016 lease commitments?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,297],[298,751],[752,3321],[3322,3331],[3332,3428],[3429,3436]],"num_tokens":765,"response":"Based on the information provided, the purchase commitments we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations to third-party contract manufacturers are $43.9 million as of December 31, 2015.

Since $43.9 million is greater than $18,810, the purchase commitments are indeed greater than expected lease commitments.  **Reasoning:** The question asks whether the purchase commitments as of December 31, 2015, are greater than expected 2016 lease commitments. The context states that the lease commitments are $18,810 as of December 31, 2015, and the purchase commitments are $43.9 million as of the same date.

Approximately $ 3. 4 million of the charge related to lease obligation costs for the cambridge wafer fabrication facility, which the company ceased using in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The remaining $ 1. 3 million of the charge related to clean-up and closure costs that were expensed as incurred. 6. Acquisitions in fiscal 2006, the company acquired substantially all the outstanding stock of privately-held integrant technologies, inc. ( integrant ) of seoul, korea. The acquisition enabled the company to enter the mobile tv market and strengthened its presence in the asian region. The company paid $ 8. 4 million related to the purchase of shares from the founder of integrant during the period from july 2007 through july 2009. The company recorded these payments as additional goodwill. In fiscal 2006, the company acquired all the outstanding stock of privately-held audioasics a\/s ( audioasics ) of roskilde, denmark. The acquisition of audioasics allows the company to continue developing low-power audio solutions, while expanding its presence in the nordic and eastern european regions. The company paid additional cash payments of $ 3. 1 million during fiscal 2009 for the achievement of revenue-based milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009, which were recorded as additional goodwill. In addition, the company paid $ 3. 2 million during fiscal 2009 based on the achievement of technological milestones during the period from october 2006 through january 2009, which were recorded as compensation expense in fiscal 2008. All revenue and technological milestones related to this acquisition have been met and no additional payments will be made. The company has not provided pro forma results of operations for integrant and audioasics herein as they were not material to the company on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

However, the data for the 4-year mark (December 31, 2013) shows that series C had a return of $316.21, and the S&P500 had a return of $165.76.\n\n5. **Determining Faithfulness**:\n   - The response correctly states that series C outperformed the S&P500 by the end of the period (December 31, 2014).\n   - However, the question specifically asks about performance \"after 4 years.\" The data for \"after 4 years\" would correspond to December 31, 2013, not December 31, 2014.\n   - At December 31, 2013, series C's return was $316.21, and the S&P500's return was $165.76, indicating that series C did outperform the S&P500 after 4 years.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Although the response references the wrong date (December 31, 2014, instead of December 31, 2013), it correctly answers the question's intent because series C outperformed the S&P500 both at the 4-year mark and at the 5-year mark.

Approximately 57100 square feet of space is occupied by our lease administration office and our broadcast division, and we lease the remaining space to unaffiliated tenants. In addition to the principal offices set forth above, we maintain 15 regional area offices in the united states through which we operate our tower leasing and services businesses. We believe that our owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our anticipated needs. We have also established an office in delhi, india to pursue business opportunities in india and southeast asia, and we have an international business development group based in london, england. Our interests in our communications sites are comprised of a variety of ownership interests, including leases created by long-term ground lease agreements, easements, licenses or rights-of-way granted by government entities. Pursuant to the loan agreement for the securitization, the tower sites subject to the securitization are subject to mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure the loan. A typical tower site consists of a compound enclosing the tower site, a tower structure, and one or more equipment shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. There are three principal types of towers: guyed, self- supporting lattice, and monopole. 2022 a guyed tower includes a series of cables attaching separate levels of the tower to anchor foundations in the ground. A guyed tower can reach heights of up to 2000 feet. A guyed tower site for a typical broadcast tower can consist of a tract of land of up to 20 acres. 2022 a lattice tower typically tapers from the bottom up and usually has three or four legs. A lattice tower can reach heights of up to 1000 feet. Depending on the height of the tower, a lattice tower site for a wireless communications tower can consist of a tract of land of 10000 square feet for a rural site or less than 2500 square feet for a metropolitan site. 2022 a monopole is a tubular structure that is used primarily to address space constraints or aesthetic concerns. Monopoles typically have heights ranging from 50 to 200 feet.

Included in the accrual balance as of november 27, 1998 were lease termination costs related to previously announced restructuring programs in fiscal 1994 and 1995. Cash payments for the twelve months ended december 3, 1999 related to both restructuring programs were $ 1. 5 million. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded adjustments to the accrual balance of approximately $ 1. 2 million related to these programs. An adjustment of $ 0. 6 million was made in the third quarter of fiscal 1999 due to the company 2019s success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified. In addition, $ 0. 6 million was reduced from the restructuring accrual relating to expired lease termination costs for two facilities resulting from the merger with frame in fiscal 1995. As of december 3, 1999 no accrual balances remain related to the aldus and frame mergers. Other charges during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1999, the company recorded other charges of $ 8. 4 million that were unusual in nature. These charges included $ 2. 0 million associated with the cancellation of a contract and $ 2. 2 million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program. Additionally, the company incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling $ 2. 6 million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of $ 1. 6 million to assist in the restructuring of the company 2019s operations.\nQuestion:what portion of the 1999 accrual balance related to restructurings is comprised of canceled contracts?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,602],[603,851],[852,3307],[3308,3317],[3318,3419],[3420,3427]],"num_tokens":840,"response":"The portion of the 1999 accrual balance related to restructurings that is comprised of canceled contracts is $0.4 million.

Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position. Credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. Credit default swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection. However, if a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection, which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract. Credit indices, baskets and tranches. Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure. Total return swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. Credit options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:Devon energy corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements 2013 ( continued ) restricted stock awards and units restricted stock awards and units are subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations, if any, that the compensation committee deems appropriate, including restrictions on continued employment. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. During the vesting period, recipients of restricted stock awards receive dividends that are not subject to restrictions or other limitations. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award or unit, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance-based restricted stock awards performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Vesting of the awards is dependent on devon meeting certain internal performance targets and the recipient meeting certain service requirements. Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from zero to four years. In order for awards to vest, the performance target must be met in the first year, and if met, recipients are entitled to dividends on the awards over the remaining service vesting period. If the performance target and service period requirements are not met, the award does not vest. Devon estimates the fair values of the awards as the closing price of devon 2019s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period. Performance share units performance share units are granted to certain members of devon 2019s senior management. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing devon 2019s tsr to the tsr of a predetermined group of fourteen peer companies over the specified two- or three- year performance period. The vesting of units may be between zero and 200% ( 200 % ) of the units granted depending on devon 2019s tsr as compared to the peer group on the vesting date. At the end of the vesting period, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: ( i ) a risk-free interest rate based on u. S. Treasury rates as of the grant date; ( ii ) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of devon and the designated peer group; and ( iii ) an estimated ranking of devon among the designated peer group. The fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period. The following table presents the assumptions related to performance share units granted.[[\"\", \"2015\", \"2014\", \"2013\"], [\"grant-date fair value\", \"$ 81. 99 2013 $ 85. 05\", \"$ 70. 18 2013 $ 81. 05\", \"$ 61. 27 2013 $ 63. 48\"], [\"risk-free interest rate\", \"1. 06% ( 1. 06 % )\", \"0. 54% ( 0. 54 % )\", \"0. 26% ( 0. 26 % ) 2013 0. 36% ( 0. 36 % )\"], [\"volatility factor\", \"26. 2% ( 26. 2 % )\", \"28. 8% ( 28. 8 % )\", \"30. 3% ( 30. 3 % )\"], [\"contractual term ( years )\", \"2. 89\", \"2. 89\", \"3. 0\"]]Stock options in accordance with devon 2019s incentive plans, the exercise price of stock options granted may not be less than the market value of the stock at the date of grant. In addition, options granted are exercisable during a period established for each grant, which may not exceed eight years from the date of grant.

Foreign exchange risk management the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk when it earns revenues, pays expenses, or enters into monetary intercompany transfers denominated in a currency that differs from its functional currency, or other transactions that are denominated in a currency other than its functional currency. The company uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts, options and cross-currency swaps, to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. These exposures are hedged, on average, for less than two years. These derivatives are accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in other comprehensive income ( loss ) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The company also uses foreign exchange derivatives, typically forward contracts and options to economically hedge the currency exposure of the company's global liquidity profile, including monetary assets or liabilities that are denominated in a non-functional currency of an entity, typically on a rolling 30-day basis, but may be for up to one year in the future. These derivatives are not accounted for as hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded each period in other income in the consolidated statements of income.\nQuestion:what is the average share price for the shares issued to employees in 2015 in u.s.?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,232],[233,496],[497,3653],[3654,3663],[3664,3746],[3747,3754]],"num_tokens":896,"response":"To determine the average share price for the shares issued to employees in the U.S. in 2015, we need to look at the information provided regarding the employee share purchase plan.

Therefore, the answer is 500,000.","response_spans":[[0,128]],"labels":[],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes.\n\nThe context states that \"data centers , 6 , 500000\" under the table describing the significant properties used in connection with various centers and warehouses. This implies that the total approximate size of the 6 data centers is 500,000 square feet. To get the size of each data center, one would need to divide the total size by the number of data centers, which is 6. However, the response directly states the total size as the size of \"each data center\", which is incorrect. But if we were to answer the question based on the total size, the response should be understood as the total size being 500,000 square feet.\n\nTo be faithful to the context, a more accurate response would be \"approximately 83,333 square feet\" (500,000 \/ 6). However, the question does not ask for this calculation, and the response directly matches the value given in the context for the total size of data centers.\n\nSo, the response is faithful in the sense that it directly quotes a value from the context, but it might be considered slightly incorrect due to the interpretation of \"each data center\". However, given the output format and the information provided:\n\n1. \"Yes\" \n\nshould be the output because the value \"500,000\" is directly mentioned in the context.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"Yes","labels_llama":0,"labels_gpt":0}

The company 2019s estimated forfeiture rate is based on an evaluation of historical, actual and trended forfeiture data. For fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company recorded share-based compensation cost of $ 172 million, $ 179 million and $ 147 million, respectively, in personnel on its consolidated statements of operations. The amount of capitalized share-based compensation cost was immaterial during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. Options options issued under the eip expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest ratably over 3 years from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:.[[\"\", \"2014\", \"2013\", \"2012\"], [\"expected term ( in years ) ( 1 )\", \"4. 80\", \"6. 08\", \"6. 02\"], [\"risk-free rate of return ( 2 )\", \"1. 3% ( 1. 3 % )\", \"0. 8% ( 0. 8 % )\", \"1. 2% ( 1. 2 % )\"], [\"expected volatility ( 3 )\", \"25. 2% ( 25. 2 % )\", \"29. 3% ( 29. 3 % )\", \"34. 9% ( 34. 9 % )\"], [\"expected dividend yield ( 4 )\", \"0. 8% ( 0. 8 % )\", \"0. 9% ( 0. 9 % )\", \"0. 9% ( 0. 9 % )\"], [\"fair value per option granted\", \"$ 44. 11\", \"$ 39. 03\", \"$ 29. 65\"]]( 1 ) beginning in fiscal 2014, assumption is based on the company 2019s historical option exercises and those of a set of peer companies that management believes is generally comparable to visa.

The relative weighting placed on visa 2019s data and peer data in fiscal 2014 was approximately 58% ( 58 % ) and 42% ( 42 % ), respectively.

Due to the material ongoing modifications of the business, management has determined that insufficient information exists to accurately develop meaningful historical pro forma financial information. Moreover, the historical operations of blockbuster materially changed during the periods preceding the acquisition as a result of blockbuster inc. 2019s bankruptcy proceedings, and any historical pro forma information would not prove useful in assessing our post acquisition earnings and cash flows. The cost of goods sold on a unit basis for blockbuster in the current period was lower-than-historical costs.

Bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york approved the asset purchase agreement with terrestar and we subsequently paid $ 1. 345 billion of the cash purchase price. Dish network is a party to the asset purchase agreement solely with respect to certain guaranty obligations. We have paid all but $ 30 million of the purchase price for the terrestar transaction, which will be paid upon closing of the terrestar transaction, or upon certain other conditions being met under the asset purchase agreement. Consummation of the acquisition contemplated in the asset purchase agreement is subject to, among other things, approval by the fcc. On february 7, 2012, the canadian federal department of industry ( 201cindustry canada 201d ) approved the transfer of the canadian spectrum licenses held by terrestar to us. If the remaining required approvals are not obtained, subject to certain exceptions, we have the right to require and direct the sale of some or all of the terrestar assets to a third party and we would be entitled to the proceeds from such a sale. These proceeds could, however, be substantially less than amounts we have paid in the terrestar transaction. Additionally, gamma is responsible for providing certain working capital and certain administrative expenses of terrestar and certain of its subsidiaries after december 31, 2011. We expect that the terrestar transaction will be accounted for as a business combination using purchase price accounting. We also expect to allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component using various valuation techniques, including the market approach, income approach and\/or cost approach.

Include any reasoning with the answer\n\nContext:American tower corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income included the following items related to derivative financial instruments ( in thousands ):.[[\"\", \"2012\", \"2011\", \"2010\"], [\"deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock net of tax\", \"$ -3827 ( 3827 )\", \"$ -4625 ( 4625 )\", \"$ -3354 ( 3354 )\"], [\"deferred gain on the settlement of interest rate swap agreements entered into in connection with the securitization net oftax\", \"2014\", \"202\", \"497\"], [\"unrealized losses related to interest rate swap agreements net of tax\", \"-4815 ( 4815 )\", \"2014\", \"-2083 ( 2083 )\"]]As of december 31, 2012, $ 1. 8 million of the amount related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months. During the years ended december 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the company recorded aggregate net unrealized ( losses ) gains of approximately $ ( 4. 8 ) million, $ 1. 9 million, and $ 9. 5 million, respectively ( net of tax benefits ( provisions ) of approximately $ 0. 7 million, $ ( 1. 3 ) million, and $ ( 6. 0 ) million, respectively ) in accumulated other comprehensive ( loss ) income for the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The company is amortizing the deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock as additional interest expense over the term of the 7. 00% ( 7. 00 % ) notes, and is amortizing the deferred gain on the settlement of interest rate swap agreements entered into in connection with the securitization as a reduction in interest expense over the five-year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges. For the year ended december 31, 2012, the company reclassified $ 0. 6 million into results of operations. The company reclassified an aggregate of $ 0. 1 million ( net of income tax provisions of $ 0. 1 million ) into results of operations during the years ended december 31, 2011 and 2010. As a result of the reit conversion described in note 1, effective december 31, 2011, the company reversed the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the entities operating its reit activities. Accordingly, approximately $ 1. 8 million of deferred tax assets associated with the deferred loss on the settlement of the treasury rate lock and the deferred gain on the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement entered into in connection with the securitization were reclassified to other comprehensive income. 12. Fair value measurements the company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nQuestion:what was the total reclassification of oci into income , in millions , during the years ended december 31 , 2012 , 2011 and 2010?\nAnswer:","prompt_spans":[[0,135],[136,144],[145,410],[411,846],[847,3740],[3741,3750],[3751,3879],[3880,3887]],"num_tokens":939,"response":"To determine the total reclassification of OCI into income during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we need to sum the amounts specified in the context:- **2012**: $0.6 million\n- **2011**: $0.1 million\n- **2010**: $0.1 millionAdding these values gives:$$\n0.6 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.8 \\text{ million}\n$$Thus, the total reclassification of OCI into income during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, in millions, is **0.8**.","response_spans":[[0,168],[169,242],[243,268],[269,311],[312,445]],"labels":[],"hallucinated_llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct":"Yes. \n\nThe response is fully supported by the context as it correctly sums the reclassification amounts for the years 2012, 2011, and 2010 as specified in the given context: $0.6 million for 2012 and $0.1 million for both 2011 and 2010, totaling $0.8 million.","hallucinated_gpt-oss-120b":"Yes","labels_llama":0,"labels_gpt":0}
